<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This present handbook is intended to aid in the
understanding of Egyptian art, and the illustrations
and descriptions are selected for that purpose only.
The history of the art would require a far greater
range of examples, in order to illustrate the growth
and decay of each of the great periods; whereas
here only the most striking works of each period
are shown, in order to contrast the different civilisations.
The origins and connections of the art in
each age are scarcely touched, and the technical details
are only such as are needed to see the conditions
of the art. The archaeology of the subject would
need as wide a treatment as the history, and these
subjects can only appear here incidentally.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the divisions of artistic
periods are often not the same as those of political
history. Politically, the history divides at the
XVIIth dynasty with the fall of the Hyksos, and
at the XXIInd dynasty with the rise of the Delta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
government. But artistically the changes are under
Tahutmes I, when Syrian influences broke in, and
under the XXVIth dynasty, when the classical
Greeks began to dominate the art.</p>

<p>The effect of foreign influence in art is quite
apart from political power; it is due to rival activities
which may or may not mean a physical
domination. The reader should ponder different
cases, such as those of the spiral design of early
Europe entering Egypt, of the Syrian and Cretan
art in the XVIIIth dynasty, of the effect of Persia
upon Greece, and of Greece upon Italy (both through
Magna Graecia and the conquest of Greece), of the
effect of the Goth, Lombard, and Northman on
Europe, and of Japan on modern Europe. Some
reflection on these great artistic movements will give
a little insight as to the history of art.</p>

<p>Regarding the illustrations, I have thought it
more useful to give details large enough to be
clearly seen, rather than to contract too much surface
into a space where it cannot well be studied.
Portions of subjects are therefore often preferred to
general views of a whole. The outlines of artistic
value, such as contours of faces or figures, are left
quite untouched, as an outline cannot be taken
seriously which is dependent on the block-maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
clearing a white or black ground. This latter treatment,
unfortunately, puts out of artistic use many of
the lavishly spaced plates of the Cairo Catalogue,
where art is subjected to bibliophily. The liberal
policy of all publications and photographs of the
Cairo Museum being free of copyright, has enabled
me to use many of the excellent untouched photographs
of Brugsch Pasha and others. My best
thanks are due to Freiherr von Bissing and the
publisher of his <i>Denkmaeler Aegypt. Sculptur</i>, for
permission to use figures 39, 44, 46, 48, 62, 111, and
112 from that work. Over a third of the illustrations
here are from my own photographs not yet
published, and principally taken for this volume.</p>

<h1>Arts and Crafts of Ancient Egypt</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHARACTER OF EGYPTIAN ART</span></h2>

<p>The art of a country, like the character of the inhabitants,
belongs to the nature of the land. The
climate, the scenery, the contrasts of each country,
all clothe the artistic impulse as diversely as they
clothe the people themselves. A burly, florid Teuton
in his furs and jewellery, and a lithe brown Indian
in his waist-cloth, would each look entirely absurd
in the other’s dress. There is no question of which
dress is intrinsically the best in the world; each is
relatively the best for its own conditions, and each
is out of place in other conditions. So it is with
art: it is the expression of thought and feeling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
harmony with its own conditions. The only bad
art is that which is mechanical, where the impulse
to give expression has decayed, and it is reduced
to mere copying of styles and motives which do
not belong to its actual conditions. An age of copying
is the only despicable age.</p>

<p>It is but a confusion of thought, therefore, to try
to pit the art of one country against that of another.
A Corinthian temple, a Norman church, or a
Chinese pavilion are each perfect in their own conditions;
but if the temple is of Aberdeen granite,
the church of Pacific island coral, and the pavilion
amid the Brighton downs, they are each of them
hopelessly wrong. To understand any art we must
first begin by grasping its conditions, and feeling
the contrasts, the necessities, the atmosphere, which
underlie the whole terms of expression.</p>

<p>Now the essential conditions in Egypt are before
all, an overwhelming sunshine; next, the strongest
of contrasts between a vast sterility of desert and
the most prolific verdure of the narrow plain; and
thirdly, the illimitable level lines of the cultivation,
of the desert plateau, and of the limestone strata,
crossed by the vertical precipices on either hand
rising hundreds of feet without a break. In such
conditions the architecture of other lands would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
look weak or tawdry. But the style of Egypt never
fails in all its varieties and changes.</p>

<p>The brilliancy of light led to adopting an architecture
of blank walls without windows. The reflected
light through open doorways was enough to
show most interiors; and for chambers far from the
outer door, a square opening about six inches each
way in the roof, or a slit along the wall a couple of
inches high, let in sufficient light. The results of
this system were, that as the walls were not divided
by structural features, they were dominated by the
scenes that were carved upon them. The wall
surface ceased to be regarded as part of a building,
and became an expansion of the papyrus or tablet.
The Egyptian belief in the magical value of representations
led to the figuring of the various parts
of the worship on the walls of the temples or tombs,
so that the divine service should be perpetually renewed
in figure; and thus what we see is not so
much a building in the ordinary sense, as an illustrated
service-book enclosing the centre of worship.
Another result of the fierce indirect light was that
which dominated sculpture. The reliefs, beautiful
as they often were, would not be distinct in the
diffuse facing light; hence strong colouring was applied
to render them clear and effective. So much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
did colouring take the lead that the finest sculptures
were often smothered in a stucco facing, laid on to
receive the colour. This almost spiteful ignoring
of the delicate craft of the sculptor is seen in the
XIIth dynasty, and was the ruling method in Ptolemaic
work.</p>

<p>The extreme contrast between the desert and
the cultivation gave its tone to the artistic sense of
the people. On either hand, always in sight, there
rose the margin of the boundless waste without life
or verdure, the dreaded region of evil spirits and
fierce beasts, the home of the nomads that were
always ready to swoop on unprotected fields and
cattle, if they did not sit down on the borders and
eat up the country. Between these two expanses
of wilderness lay the narrow strip of richest earth,
black, wet, and fertile under the powerful sun; teeming
with the force of life, bearing the greenest of
crops, as often in the year as it could be watered.
In parts may be seen three full crops of corn or
beans raised each year beneath the palms that also
give their annual burden of fruit; fourfold does the
rich ground yield its ever-growing stream of life.</p>

<p class="caption">1. The barren desert background</p>

<p class="caption">2. The luxuriance of the plain</p>

</div>

<p>This exuberance amid absolute sterility is reflected
in the proportion between the minuteness
of detail and the vastness of the architecture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
most gigantic buildings may have their surfaces
crowded with delicate sculpture and minute colouring.
What would be disproportionate elsewhere,
seems in harmony amid such natural contrasts.</p>

<p>The strongly marked horizontal and vertical lines
of the scenery condition the style of buildings that
can be placed before such a background. As the
temples were approached, the dominant line was
the absolute level of the green plain of the Nile
valley, without a rise or slope upon it. Behind
the building the sky line was the level top of the
desert plateau, only broken by an occasional valley,
but with never a peak rising above it. And the
face of the cliffs that form the stern setting is
ruled across with level lines of strata, which rise
in a step-like background or a wall lined across as
with courses of masonry. The weathering of the
cliffs breaks up the walls of rock into vertical pillars
with deep shadows between them. In the face
of such an overwhelming rectangular framing any
architecture less massive and square than that of
Egypt would be hopelessly defeated. The pediments
of Greece, the circular arches of Rome, the
pointed arches of England, would all seem crushed
by so stern a setting. The harmony is shown
most clearly in the temple of Deir el Bahri (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
below its cliffs which overshadow it. Let any other
kind of building be set there, and it would be an
impertinent intrusion; the long level lines of the
terraces and roofs, the vertical shadows of the
colonnades, repose in perfect harmony with the
mass of Nature around them. The Egyptian was
quite familiar with the arch: he constantly used it
in brickwork on a large scale, and he imitated its
curve in stone; yet he always hid it in his building,
and kept it away from the external forms, instinctively
knowing that it could not serve any part of
his decorative construction.</p>

<p>These principles, which were thus imposed on the
architecture of Egypt, were doubly enforced upon
its sculpture. Not only did Nature set the framing
of plain and cliff, but her work was reflected
and reiterated by the massive walls, square pillars,
and flat architraves, amid which Egyptian sculpture
had to take its place. In such shrines it would be
disastrously incongruous to place a Victory poising
on one foot, or a dancing faun. They belong to
the peaks of Greece, divided by rushing streams,
and clothed with woods,&mdash;to a transient world of
fleeting beauty, not to a landscape and an architecture
of eternity. Egyptian art, however luxurious,
however playful it might be, was always framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
on a tacit groundwork of its natural conditions.
Within those conditions there was scope for most
vivid portraiture, most beautiful harmony, most delicate
expression, but the Egyptian was wise enough
to know his conditions and to obey them. In that
obedience lay his greatness.</p>

<p>The truest analysis of art&mdash;that of Tolstoy&mdash;results
in defining it as a means of communicating
emotion. It may be the emotion produced by
beauty or by loathsomeness; each expression is
equally art, though each is not equally desirable art.
The emotion may be imparted by words, by forms,
by sounds; all are equally vehicles of different kinds
of art. But without imparting an emotional perception
to the mind there is no art. The emotion
may be the highest, that of apprehending character,
and the innate meaning of mind and of Nature; or
it may be the lower form of sharing in the transient
interests and excitements of others; or the
basest form of all, that of enjoying their evil. How
does the Egyptian appear under this analysis?
What emotions can we consider were intended by
his art? How far did he succeed in imparting them
to the spectators?</p>

<p>To understand the mind of the artist we must
look to those qualities which in their literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
were held up as the ideals of life. Stability and
Strength were the qualities most admired, and the
name for public monuments was “firm things.”
Assuredly all mankind has looked on the works of
Egypt as giving a sense of these qualities before
all others. Closely connected is the sense of Endurance,
which was enjoined in words, and carried
into practice in the laborious work on the hardest
rocks. It was for endurance that statues were made
of diorite or granite, though they were painted with
life-like hues, so that their material was scarcely
seen. Upon these primary qualities was built a
rich and varied character, reflected in the elaborate
and beautiful sculpture which covered, but never
interfered with, the grand mass of a monument.
Truth and Justice were qualities much sought for
in life, and were expressed by the artist in the
reality of his immense blocks of stone, often more
hidden than seen, and in the fair and even bearing
of all material, without any tricks or paradoxes
of structure. In all his earlier work his monolith
columns and pillars were a protest that a structural
unit must express unity, that what supports others
must not be in itself divided. The Discipline and
Harmony which were looked on as the bond of
social life are shown by the subordination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whole, by the carrying out of single schemes of
decoration illustrating the use of every part of a
building on all its walls, by the balance of the proportions
of the whole so that there seems a perfect
fitness of connection through all parts. And the
happy union of vigorous Action with prudent Reserve,
which showed the wise man in the proverbs,
is the basis of those life-like scenes which cover the
walls of the tombs, but which never betray the
artist into attempting impossibilities or revealing
too much.</p>

<p>As true art, then&mdash;that is, the expression of his
being, and the communication to others of his best
feelings and sense of things&mdash;the Egyptian work
must stand on the highest plane of reality. It would
have been a falsehood to his nature to aspire, as
a Gothic architect sometimes did, in towers and
pinnacles which crush their foundations and will
not hold together without incongruous bonds. Nor
did he wish to express the romantic sense of beauty,
in structure which may tend to exceed the limits
of stability. All that belongs to the atmosphere of
troubadours and knights errant. The Egyptian possessed
in splendid perfection the sense of Strength,
Permanence, Majesty, Harmony, and effective Action,
tempered with a sympathy and kindliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
which cemented a vast disciplined fabric. And
these aims of life as a whole he embodied and expressed
in his art, with a force and truth which
has impressed his character on all who look on his
works. He fulfils the canon of true art as completely
as any race that has come after him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PERIODS AND SCHOOLS</span></h2>

<p>Before we can understand any art the first step is
to discriminate between the different periods and
their various styles, and to observe the characteristics
of the several schools. If we consider medieval
architecture, we separate the many periods from
Saxon to Renaissance; if we turn to painting, we distinguish
many stages between Cimabue and Canaletto,
yet these variations belong but to a single
revolution of civilisation, and are comprised within
some centuries; in Egyptian art we have to deal
with seven revolutions of civilisation and thousands
of years. And not only the period, but also
the source and traditions of each local branch of
the art are to be recognised, and we discriminate
a dozen schools of painting between Rome and
Venice, each with its own style. So in Egypt we
need to learn the various schools and understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
their differences. In this chapter we shall notice
the essential characters of each period and school
as compared together; while in the following chapters
the more technical detail of the statuary, reliefs,
and paintings will be considered.</p>

<p>In order to grasp more readily the differences of
period and of place, there are given here eight
typical examples of different periods (<a href="#fig3">figs. 3 to 10</a>),
and four examples of different schools during one
reign (<a href="#fig11">figs. 11 to 14</a>). These may be supplemented
by reference to subsequent illustrations, but the contrasts
will be more readily seen in a simultaneous
view.</p>

<p>The Prehistoric work (8000-5500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) shows
much more mechanical than artistic ability. The
treatment of the hardest materials was masterful;
granite and porphyry were wrought as freely as limestone
and alabaster; perfectly regular forms of vases
were cut entirely by hand without any lathe. But
with this there was a very tentative idea of animate
forms. The feet and hands were omitted, and limbs
ended only in points. The form of an outline was
not thought to imply a solid, and it needed to be
hatched over with cross lines (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) to show that it
was a continuous body. The noses of animals are
frequently shown touching, as in this instance of the
dog and addax. In short, the figures are mere symbols
of ideas, with little regard to their actual nature
and appearance. This symbolic stage of art is found
in most countries, and often with a higher sense of
form and expression than among the prehistoric
people of the Nile; there is nothing of this age in
Egypt to compare with the carvings of the cave men
of Europe.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Early. Late.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There is no sign of progress in art during this
time. The slate palettes, cut in the
forms of animal outlines, which were
made through the whole age, begin
with recognisable forms; and these
were degraded by copying, until at
the end their original types could
hardly be guessed. The animal figures on ivory
combs are passable in the earlier part of the age,
and disappear entirely later on. The human figures,
which are frequent in early times, are very rarely
found later. The flint working shows degeneration
long before historic times. And the pottery loses
its fine forms, regularity, and brilliant finish, and
becomes rough and coarse. In every direction it
seems that the earliest prehistoric civilisation, which
was probably connected with Libya, was superseded
by a lower race, which was probably from the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The first dynasty (5500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) appears to have
brought in entirely new influences. While the material
civilisation naturally went on with many of
the older elements, yet in all directions a new spirit
and moving power is seen. The conquest of the
country by a race of invaders is shown on many
carvings, most of which are probably of the three
centuries of unification, before the start of the dynastic
history of the whole country. One of the
most typical of these carvings is <a href="#fig3">fig. 4</a>, where the
king is represented as a bull trampling upon his
enemy. Other examples are given in <a href="#fig51">figs. 51 to 54</a>.</p>

<p>The whole character of the art is changed. Instead
of the clumsy and spiritless figures of the prehistoric
people, we meet with vigorous forms full
of life and character. Perhaps one of the earliest
is the hyaena (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>); the slates are rather later,
reaching down to the beginning of the first dynasty;
and the figures in the round (<a href="#fig19">19 to 22</a>) show what
a living and powerful art had suddenly sprung up
and was developed under the early kings. The
same growth is seen in the advance of glazing for
important architectural use on a large scale. And
the introduction and rapid development of hieroglyphic
writing stamps the new age as the beginning
of written history, the start of the conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
preservation by man of a regular record of his past
acts.</p>

<p>This new growth of art rejoiced in its fresh found
powers. It searched for the truth, it carefully observed
anatomy, and&mdash;like a learner&mdash;it was proud
of its knowledge, and emphasised the precise place
of the muscles which it had traced out. For that
very reason it is essentially a true art, without any
of the slovenly substitutes for Nature which are
termed conventions. It had no traditions to spoil
it or hold it back: it was full of observation as the
only method for its work. It is always simple and
dignified, and shows more truth and precision than
any art of a later age.</p>

<p>After the conscious study of Nature, the greatest
step in any art is the deliberate work for the sake
of its own beauty, and not merely because it has
to tell a story. It may be said that this is the
birth of true art; all before that merely consists of
representations for another purpose. But work for
the sake of beauty alone is art pure and simple,
and this stage was reached at the very beginning
of the history, in the beautiful carving of the palm
tree and long-necked gazelles (<a href="#fig51">fig. 52</a>).</p>

<p>The Pyramid age (4700-4000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) brought in
fresh ideals. The early kings had expanded a chieftainship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
into a kingdom, without realising all the
new conditions of organization which were involved.
The great work of the early pyramid kings, Senoferu
and Khufu, was the massive organizing of
the civil service of the country, the establishment
of a social organism which resisted all the invasions
and disasters of the land, and survived in parts to
our own times. These new ideals were naturally
reflected in the art. In place of tombs such as
any great chief might have ordered, the most
gigantic pyramids were erected, buildings yet unsurpassed
in bulk and in accuracy of workmanship.
The new social order of the official world followed
in the same lines, and dozens of tombs were sculptured
in each reign, larger and more elaborate than
most of the royal sepulchres of other lands and ages.
The host of these tombs which remain constitute
a larger treasury of artistic work than there is of
any other period in the world’s history.</p>

<p>A typical example of this new order is the figure
of a servant of a noble named Ainofer (<a href="#fig3">fig. 5</a>). The
high rounded relief, the sense of action, the delicacy
of detail and expression, all mark this new time.
The greater part of the really fine sculpture that we
possess in Egypt comes from this time. The statuary
(<a href="#fig23">figs. 23 to 31</a>), the reliefs (<a href="#fig55">figs. 55 to 57</a>), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
painting (<a href="#fig65">fig. 68</a>), all show the noble spaciousness
and grandeur of the age. Its style is severe and
never trifles with superfluities. The smallest as well
as the largest work seems complete and inevitable,
without being constrained by any limitations of
time, or labour, or thought. For the expression of
royal energy, dignity, and equanimity the figures
of Khufu and Khafra are unsurpassed. In the vivid
expression of personal character no age has surpassed
the statues of the officials and their wives.
The style of other ages may be more scholastic,
more amusing, or more graceful, but for all that
constitutes great art no period can compare with
that of the mighty pyramid kings.</p>

<p>All things pass away, and during the centuries
of disruption which followed the VIth dynasty the
old style ran down to an incredible coarseness and
clumsy copying. At the close of the XIth dynasty
a revival took place. Like all great developments
of art it rose with extraordinary rapidity, and within
a generation or two the new movement was fully
grown. Its characteristic was the use of very low
relief, with faint but perfectly clear outlines (see
<a href="#fig3">fig. 6</a>). It was the style of a school, and not that
of Nature. A regular course of artistic training is
described by an artist; first was taught the positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of figures in slow action, then the differences
of male and female figures, next mythological subjects,
and lastly, the attitudes of rapid action. This
mechanical training naturally went with elaboration
of detail. The minute lining over large masses
of hair, the carving of every bead of a necklace,
were the outcome of scholastic training. The artificial
reduction of figures in the round to a very
delicate variation of planes in low relief was according
to the same system. The whole works of the
XIIth dynasty are beautiful, reserved, and pleasing,
with a clearness and finish which appeals to a sense
of orderly perfection. They have neither the grandeur
of what went before nor the grace of what
followed them.</p>

</div>

<p>The XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties are the most
popularly known age of the art. The profusion
of remains, their accessibility at Thebes, and the
more intimate style of the designs, have led to their
general acceptance as typical. This position must
not be allowed in a wider knowledge of the subject.
The whole level of art of the XVIIIth dynasty
is as much below that of the XIIth, as the style of
the XIIth is below that of the IVth dynasty. The
scholastic work of the XIIth is followed by a treatment
which is almost always conventional in the
XVIIIth; and the XIXth dynasty shows merely a
degradation of what preceded it. At the close of the
XVIIth dynasty there emerges from the turmoil of
the Hyksos barbarism a rude but lively style of
drawing, with sculpture of clumsy figures and badly-formed
hieroglyphs. Stepping into the XVIIIth
dynasty we meet with stiff and rather heavy statuettes,
the female figures, however, showing the dawn
of the seductive grace which followed. Little can
be said to have changed in ideals since the XIIth
dynasty, until the Asiatic conquests altered the
civilisation of Egypt. Thothmes I and III brought
back thousands of Syrian captives, many of whom
were selected for their beauty and their artistic
ability; their work and their influence transformed
the art, and the ideal became that of a light, graceful,
fascinating type which posed much and suggested
more.</p>

<p>The art of character had become secondary to
the art of emotion. Vivacity and romance led the
way, and the older studies of deeper life and fine
anatomy were out of date. Fluttering ribbons and
prancing horses and galloping calves were represented
without the laborious sculpture, but merely
painted with a flowing line on the tomb walls, which
were plastered smooth over the roughest hewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the rock. The cheapest road to effect was the
favourite way, and the eternal solidity and dignified
simplicity of the older ages had vanished. The
figure of an official of Kha-em-hat (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) is typical
of the best work of this age. The other examples
are shown in figs. <a href="#fig23">36-42</a>, <a href="#fig60">60-62</a>, <a href="#fig69">69-78</a>.
This new order of things culminated under Akhenaten,
when naturalism, influenced largely from
Greece, removed the older principles of Egyptian
art; and all the passing incidents of life, the domestic
affections of the king and the festivities of
his court, became the subjects of even funerary
sculptures and painting in the tombs. After that
stage there was nothing left to do but to fall back
on the old stock subjects and copy and re-copy them
worse and worse during the succeeding dynasties.
Egyptian art perishes with Akhenaten; all that
came after was a bloodless imitation.</p>

<p>The XIXth dynasty art is fairly represented by
a figure of one of the king’s sons (<a href="#fig7">fig. 8</a>). Here
is seen the baldness of the style. The profile is
mechanical, the hair hangs in a heavy and ugly flap,
the body has no anatomy, the legs are badly drawn,
and the long streamers flying from the waist are
out of keeping. The coarse, heavy work of the
temples of Abu Simbel, or the great hall of Karnak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is obtrusive in spite of their grandiose conception.
In the XXth dynasty the inscriptions also
suffered by being cut very deeply, so that the signs
appeared as black shadows without any detail. The
decay was only arrested by a deliberate copying of
the style of the pyramid age.</p>

<p>The XXVIth dynasty tried to recover the early
grandeur of sculpture by close imitation, but it is
rarely that any fragment of this work does not betray
itself by its inane treatment, bad jointing of the
limbs, and want of proportion. One of the best
examples of the more original work is the figure
of an elderly official (<a href="#fig7">fig. 9</a>). The want of detail
is hidden by the stiff robe without a fold or curve,
leaving only the head and extremities to be represented.
Another example is in <a href="#fig63">fig. 64</a>, where the
bad jointing and lack of anatomy is too evident.</p>

<p>In the Ptolemaic time these faults are even more
apparent, when the bad copy of a copy was the ideal.
In <a href="#fig7">fig. 10</a> is seen the hopelessly wrong proportioning
of the parts, the clumsy lumps of flesh and
exaggerated muscles, which are the extreme opposite
to the over-refined flat relief of the XIIth
dynasty. The hair partakes of the same faults,
being carved as rows of lumps representing separate
curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Portraiture, which compelled some attention to
Nature, is the latest surviving form of art. In the
XXVIth dynasty fairly good heads were occasionally
done, but often with some disproportion. The
modelled stucco heads of the Roman age are the
last stage. Some of them show a real ability and
feeling for character (<a href="#fig135">figs. 135 to 137</a>), and one
example which can be compared with the skull
proves the accuracy of the modelling (<a href="#fig135">fig. 138</a>).</p>

<p>The various Schools of Art should now be noticed.
The styles of the different periods that we
have considered were of course obvious in all the
schools; the character of an age affected all parts of
the country. Owing to the absence of any artists’
names, and the extreme rarity of those of architects,
it is impossible to trace the personal origin of any
works. And as we cannot say how much the artists
travelled about the country, mere locality does not
prove a conclusive test; probably for royal works
the artists went to any city according to orders.
Among private tombs we can see great differences
of style, as between Memphis, Thebes, and Aswan.
But the difficulty of exact dating makes comparison
doubtful, as we might set side by side works of
the rise and of the climax of a period. The most
satisfactory evidence about the schools is from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
statuary in different materials. When once a sculptor
was trained to the peculiarities of one stone he
would not be likely to enter on all the difficulties
of a fresh material. A man trained for years to
slicing and bruising out granite without the least
fear of a crack, would not relish hewing soft sandstones
that split, or limestone that could not be
trusted with its own weight on a finished surface.
Certainly the men who learned sculpture on the
softer materials would be helpless on the granite.
Then we know that the statues were at least dressed
into shape&mdash;if not entirely finished&mdash;at the quarries,
and hence the work in one material would continue
in the hands of one local school. It is therefore
likely that the stone workers of each material formed
an unbroken succession, probably in certain families
for the most part, and handed on their traditions
for several dynasties successively, perhaps even
throughout thousands of years. This would not be
so much the case in relief sculpture, as there the
blocks were built in and sculptured at the building,
wherever that might be.</p>

<p>When we look for differences of treatment we
see how strongly one style of work is continued
in one material through a long period. We have
here contemporaneous examples in four different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stones, the statues of Rameses II in black granite,
hard limestone, red granite and Nubian sandstone
(<a href="#fig11">figs. 11 to 14</a>). In all cases work in black granite
is finer than that in the other stones at the same
period. The figures of the so-called Hyksos type
(<a href="#fig32">fig. 34</a>), of the XIIIth, the XVIIIth, the XIXth
and the XXVth dynasties, and the sarcophagi of
the XVIIIth dynasty, in black granite, all show
far finer forms and finish than those in the other
materials. Of briefer use there were two other
stones which show equally fine work&mdash;diorite, which
was hardly ever sculptured except in the IVth
dynasty (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>), and green basalt, used in the
XVIIIth (<a href="#fig36">fig. 37</a>). The green basalt must be put
in the highest place as regards minute handling and
freedom of curves; the fine grain and moderate hardness
were most favourable to the artist. The black
granite work comes next in quality, having fine
curves but not quite the same freedom, owing to the
coarser grain. The diorite has a beautiful grain for
work, but the hardness has influenced the detail of
recesses, and it is seldom that inner angles are as
truly worked out as in the black granite. The comparison
is perhaps hardly just, as there are no contemporary
works in these two stones. It seems
not improbable that all these hard stones were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the same region, the Eastern desert, and that
they were all worked by one school. That there
was a fine technical training there in early times
is shown by the splendid bowls and vases of the
hardest rocks which were wrought in prehistoric
ages and the first dynasty. Such vases were made
in the mountain district, as the figures of a warmly-clad
race bear them in tribute to the Egyptian king
(<i>Jour. Anthrop. Inst.</i>, xxxi., pl. xix., 13-15). Thus
we may look on this black-granite school as belonging
really to the border people of the Eastern desert,
and not to the Nile plain.</p>

</div>

<p>The limestone school was expressly that of Memphis
and Middle Egypt. It is best known from the
host of private statues found in the cemetery of
Saqqareh. Work of the finest delicacy was done in
this soft and uniform material (see figs. <a href="#fig23">24</a>, <a href="#fig29">29-32</a>);
and a branch of the same school was that working
the harder limestones which were a favourite stone
in the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties in upper
Egypt, as in the colossus of Rameses II (<a href="#fig11">fig. 12</a>).
Both branches of this school excelled in the delicate
expression of physiognomy; the proportions of the
limbs and the finish of the extremities are usually
excellent. The alabaster work is a branch of this
same school, with similar proportion and finish. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is a rare material for sculpture till the XVIIIth dynasty,
but under Amenhotep II to IV it was often
used; and it serves for one of the best works of
later time, the statue of Amenardys (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>). The
quarries were in the midst of the limestone hills,
especially where the hard limestone occurs near
Tell-el-Amarna. Thus the same school dealt with
this whole group of calcareous rocks.</p>

<p>Another very fine school was that of the quartzite
sandstone of Gebel Ahmar, near Cairo. The material
was closely limited to a single hill cemented
by hot springs; and what is now seen there is only
the immense heap of chippings left by workers of
all ages: the hill itself has almost vanished. This
material was worked in the pyramid times, but only
roughly. The XIIth dynasty kings saw its value,
and quarried it for sarcophagi and chambers, but
seldom used it for sculpture. The XVIIIth dynasty
attacked it on an enormous scale; the two
great colossi of Amenhotep III, weighing 1175 tons
each, were cut and carried up-stream 450 miles to
Thebes. Statues are found, royal and private, in
all parts of the land, and naturally this stone was
largely used at Tanis. The work is usually excellent,
almost equal to the limestone sculpture; but
it generally falls a little below that of the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
schools in the depth of cutting and the freedom of
work in hollows.</p>

<p>The red granite school was at Aswan, where the
statues and obelisks are still lying unfinished in the
quarries. The artist was much hindered by the
coarse grain of the stone, which made fine work
difficult. On the obelisks this has been fairly overcome
by a great amount of emery cutting, and
sharp smooth hieroglyphs were cleanly cut. But
for statuary, even in the pyramid age the features
are coarsely worked and the detail scanty; and
when used later on a large scale, the forms are
heavy, the inner angles seldom worked out, and the
extremities thick and massive. This is seen in the
colossus of Rameses II (<a href="#fig11">fig. 13</a>), as well as in earlier
figures.</p>

<p>The Nubian sandstone school was the least artistic.
The softness and ready splitting of the stone
prevented clean and well-finished work. Detail was
almost impossible, and it was a mistake to use a good
building stone for the wrong purpose of fine carving.
In early times this stone was never used, except
locally in its own region. The XIIth dynasty
rarely used it, but by the middle of the XVIIIth it
became general, and it was the main stone of the
XIXth dynasty in Upper Egypt. Its use, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
does not come down to Middle or Lower Egypt.
The long avenue of sphinxes at Thebes are the
most familiar sculpture in this material, and similar
figures were also placed by Amenhotep III in his
temple on the Western bank. The great colossi of
Abu Simbel are the main example of sculpture in
this stone (<a href="#fig11">fig. 14</a>). They show the defects of the
other southern school, that of red granite. The
limbs are square and heavy, the feet and hands are
flat and mechanical, and the muscles are crude
ridges. But the face is fairly rendered, as well perhaps
as was practicable in such material.</p>

<p>We thus see that there were essential differences
between the various schools of Egyptian art, partly
due to the various peoples, but mainly resulting
from the material used by each school.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STATUARY</span></h2>

<p>Figures in the round are the earliest mode of modelling,
and remain the most important, as they are
less conditioned than reliefs, and give full scope to
ability and knowledge. The earliest human figures
are found in the second stage of the prehistoric age,
immediately after the white-lined pottery. They
are of ivory, limestone, slate, pottery, or of stick and
paste. Such figures did not continue to be made
after the middle of the prehistoric civilisation. The
ivory figures usually end in a mere peg below, with
wide hips and shoulders, but no arms. The eyes
are marked, though often the mouth and nose are
omitted (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). The limestone or cement figures
have the division of the legs lined out; some are
standing, as <a href="#fig15">fig. 16</a>, with tatu marks painted on
the stone; others are of the armless form, seated,
and clearly of the steatopygous Bushman type. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
slate figures are always of men, with pointed beards,
and white beads inserted for eyes. The pottery
figures are roughly modelled, but with the legs separated.
The stick and paste figures are made by
modelling a vegetable paste over a stick; the legs
are marked, sometimes arms are added, or else there
are merely shoulder stumps. In one case the head
is modelled bald, painted red, and has a black wig
modelled over it, showing that separate wigs are
as old as the prehistoric time. Some ivory tusks
are carved with a much more advanced style of
heads (<a href="#fig15">fig. 17</a>), which give the best idea that we
have of the type of the people. The animal figures
are rudely cut, but have a certain ferocious air
(<a href="#fig15">fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>Some much more advanced figures in ivory have
the legs and arms separate, and a passable amount
of modelling in the head and body. Though quite
of prehistoric style, they are probably influenced by
the school of highly developed ivory-work of the
Ist dynasty, and may shortly precede that time.</p>

<p class="caption">15, 16, 17, 18. Prehistoric figures in the round</p>

</div>

<p>The early dynastic age brought in entirely new
ideals. The oldest figures of this time are the colossal
statues of the god Min from Koptos. These
are of much the same work as the prehistoric human
figures, but have spirited drawings of animals incised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on them (see <a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>). Just before the Ist
dynasty there came a finely developed style of ivory-carving,
which is known to us by the many figures
of men and women found at Hierakonpolis. The
finest stone-work of that age is a study in limestone
of a king’s head (figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <a href="#fig19">20</a>), which is so closely
like Narmer (<a href="#fig51">fig. 54</a>) that it must be just at the
beginning of the Ist dynasty. It is a sculptor’s
study of a king preparatory to making his statue,
and, as Professor A. Michaelis says, “it renders the
race-type with astounding keenness, and shows an
excellent power of observation in the exact representation
of the eyes.” The delicacy of the facial
curves should be noticed, and the entire absence
of any conventions in the modelling of the mouth
as well as the eyes. The widely prominent ears are
a characteristic of the earliest historic figures; such
a feature belongs to a hunting race who need to
catch sounds, and suggests that they always slept
on their backs. This is unlike the prehistoric folk,
who were always buried contracted and lying on
the side, as being their natural attitude; but it agrees
with the modern Egyptian, who sleeps in the mummy
posture, lying on the back.</p>

<p>A large number of ivory figures were found at
Abydos, fully developed in style, beyond those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Hierakonpolis. They comprise figures of girls,
boys, dogs, apes, a bear, and many lions. They are
admirably easy in their pose, and perfectly natural
in form with a simplicity and truthfulness better
than any later work. The figure of an old king (<a href="#fig19">fig.
21</a>) was with these; notice the subtle expression
of the face, the droop of the head forward, and
the natural air. This is probably early in the Ist
dynasty.</p>

<p>Rather later is the hard limestone head of King
Kha-sekhem, of the IInd dynasty (<a href="#fig19">fig. 22</a>). Fine
as the modelling is about the mouth, yet convention
has already crept in; the edges of the lips are sharpened,
and the extended line at the outer corner
of the eye has been introduced. We see then under
the earliest dynasties the observation of Nature free
from any artificial trammels, unconscious, simple and
dignified, on a higher plane of truthfulness and precision
than is found in later art.</p>

<p>In the pyramid age we will first observe the
earlier private figures (<a href="#fig23">23 to 26</a>). Queen Mertitefs
(<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) was the wife of Seneferu, at the close of
the IIIrd dynasty. In her type of face, and the
treatment of it, we see an earlier race and earlier
work than that of the pyramid times. The large,
staring eyes, the mouth turning down, the natural
hair cut short and brushed straight down over the
forehead beneath the wig,&mdash;all these details disappear
after this. When we compare this with the
head of Nofert (<a href="#fig23">fig. 24</a>), who was of the next generation,
the change of type and work is at once seen.
In Nofert the eyes are admirably placed, the brow is
perfectly natural, and the modelling of the features
is irreproachable. Yet there is less absolute naturalism
than in the older work of the Ist dynasty.
The hair is evidently kept complete beneath the
wig, and is laid out smoothly over the forehead.</p>

<p class="caption">26. Unknown</p>

</div>

<p>The celebrated figure of Ka-aper, or the “Sheykh
el Beled,” belongs to the same period. The figure
is so well known that it need not appear here, but
the full face is less familiar (<a href="#fig23">fig. 25</a>). The mouth
and chin are perhaps the most truthful part, and
seem entirely free from convention. The eyes are
excellent in form, but affected by the technical detail
of inserting the eyeball of stone and crystal in
a copper frame. The similar eyes in the head of
Nofert are more carefully inserted, so that the frame
is not obvious. The hair is represented as closely
cut, so as to allow the wig to be put over it. We
can, however, hardly judge of this figure as it is,
stripped of the coat of coloured stucco which covered
such work. The portions of similar wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
figures in the temple of Abydos had all been thus
painted. Such a coat would modify the eye setting,
and leave only the dark line visible which imitated
the kohl on the eyelids.</p>

<p>Another work of the same age is the best for the
pose of the figure (<a href="#fig23">fig. 26</a>). The vigorous, independent,
frank attitude is perhaps the finest in any portrait,
ancient or modern. The profile is of the same
type as that of Nofert, alike in the strong brow and
the form of the nose and chin; the eye is more
prominent, and the mouth less luxurious, while the
under-chin is firmer. Such differences are all in
keeping with the character, that of an active mistress
of an estate rather than an easy-going noble.</p>

<p>We shall not find in any of the subsequent work
of the pyramid age&mdash;still less in the later ages&mdash;such
vitality and strength of individual character as
we have seen in these early portraits. With these
stands also the minute head of Khufu (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>),
which we shall notice with the ivory-work.</p>

<p class="caption">27, 28. King Khafra (IVth dynasty)</p>

</div>

<p>The statue of Khafra (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) carved in diorite
is one of the grandest works of Egypt. The entire
dignity and majesty shown contrast strongly with
the active air of the subordinate classes. The muscular
detail is powerful, but yet in keeping with the
serenity of the figure. The whole is best grasped
from below, as it was intended to be seen; but the
head should be studied at its own level, and the
profile, from a cast (<a href="#fig27">fig. 28</a>), shows the form as it
originally appeared when covered with a facing
which concealed the grain of the stone. The difference
of character between the calm, easy dignity
of this, and the terrible energy of Khufu (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>),
should be observed. It shows how free the art is
from any mere convention of majesty. The hawk
behind the king is shown as spreading out its wings
to protect the royal head. This symbolism is ingeniously
hidden in the front view, so as not to
interfere with the effect of the whole figure as it
was intended to be seen. The figures of the Vth
and VIth dynasties have more vivacity than those
earlier, but scarcely such a real vitality. The well-known
scribe (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>) is a good piece of expression,
showing the attentive, waiting air of a man who is
following dictation. The anatomy is not detailed,
and the surfaces look rather blocked out and bald
as compared with Khafra.</p>

</div>

<p>The lower part of a group is given here (<a href="#fig29">fig. 30</a>)
for figures of the seated wife and daughter. These
show good modelling of the figure in a close-fitting
garment, and the hair is worn over the forehead
beneath the wig, as by Nofert. The figure of Ranofer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
(<a href="#fig29">fig. 31</a>) is one of the most dignified of the
portraits of officials. The pose is strong; the
muscles are well rendered, and not too full though
clear. The wig stands well off the head, and gives
a continuous outline with the figure. It is hard to
see how the whole expression could be better than
this.</p>

<p>On looking closely at the detail of these early
statues, there is very little that can be set down as
conventional. All the features are natural, well
placed, and harmonious. The relation of the brow
to the eyes is generally true. But this point was
entirely missed in later times. In the XIIth dynasty
the eye is rather too forward; and in the XVIIIth
there is hardly a single statue that is correct, the
eyes usually projecting to the plane of the brow.
On observing even the finest figures of later times
it will be seen how purely conventional is their
treatment; the mouth and eyes are cold and mechanical,
and it is seldom that any one feature even
approaches the truth of the early art.</p>

<p>In the XIIth dynasty the work shows the scholastic
style of deliberate accuracy, without as much
personal vitality as in earlier times. Yet it is full of
carefully observed detail, and is by no means perfunctory
like the later work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The facial surfaces are well rendered: observe
the varied treatment of the cheek below the eye
in figs. <a href="#fig32">32</a>, <a href="#fig32">33</a>, and <a href="#fig32">35</a>, which are clearly individual.
The entirely different form of the mouth in these
three is as evidently personal. Throughout Egyptian
work the eye is of two distinct types, both of
which we see here in the XIIth dynasty. In one
type (<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>) the upper lid rises to its highest point
near the inner side; and with this form the actual
corner, or canthus major, may end in a mere angle
or in a lachrymal fossa more or less developed, an
extreme case of the long and wide fossa being seen
in <a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>, and in the black granite figure from Alexandria
(so-called Hyksos) in Cairo. This may be
called the gibbous form of lid, and it is the more
usual in the sculpture and on coffins. The use of
a copper frame round the inserted eye in Old Kingdom
statues makes it uncertain how far the lachrymal
fossa was intended to appear. But the statues
of a single material show a small fossa in most cases,
such as Khafra, Dadefra, the (so-called) wife of the
Sheykh, and Sebekhotep III. In later work there
is no fossa, but only an angle, as in Tahutmes III,
Amenhotep III, Amenhotep son of Hapi, and other
instances to the end of the dynasties. But a slight
fossa is shown in Akhenaten and his family, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Ramessu II; and, under the Ethiopians, Taharqa
and Amenardys are both shown with a long fossa.</p>

<p>The other type of eye seen in figs. <a href="#fig32">33</a>, <a href="#fig32">35</a> may be
called the narrow eye. This seems to belong mainly
to the Middle Kingdom, and is seen in Senusert III,
Amenemhat III, Queen Nofert, and Noferhotep.
It is perhaps unknown at an earlier age; and later
it rarely occurs, but may be seen in Merenptah, and
somewhat in Mentu-em-hat and some portraits of
the XXVIth dynasty. These remarks are merely
to draw attention to a detail which is easily observed
and seldom defaced; but for drawing conclusions an
extensive study is needed of all the varieties of form
and treatment, not only of the eye, but also of the
lips, nostrils, ears, and hair. How far such detail
belonged to the subject, and how much is due to
artistic conventions, we cannot yet say; but from the
similarities of portraits of the same person it seems
probable that the details are really due to differences
of type.</p>

</div>

<p>We now have a very difficult question to state as
to the origin of the remarkable type of <a href="#fig32">fig. 34</a>. This
is one of the class of sphinxes and statues commonly
described as being of the Hyksos. Yet, as
the Hyksos kings’ names are roughly cut on the
shoulders of the sphinxes, they are clearly not the
original inscriptions; and, as clearly, these figures
are older than the Hyksos. The type is distinguished
by an extreme muscularity of the face, deeply
cut, powerful lips with strong flexures, and the
long nose, not very prominent, but broad. All these
points are much in excess of such features on any
statue of a named Egyptian king. Some similarities
may be seen in the type of Senusert III and
Amenemhat III (figs. <a href="#fig32">33</a>, <a href="#fig32">35</a>); but these latter are
much less strong and unconventional. It is probable
that some of the stock of <a href="#fig32">fig. 34</a> has gone to
form the type of figs. <a href="#fig32">33</a> and <a href="#fig32">35</a>, but it is impossible
to see in them a uniform single type. It seems most
probable that <a href="#fig32">fig. 34</a> belongs to an invading people
from Syria during the decadence of the Old Kingdom,
between the VIIth and Xth dynasties; but until
some example with an original name may be found,
it is useless to be more definite. It is noticeable
how all of the heads of this type are in black granite,
or rarely some other igneous rock; this suggests
that they were wrought by the school of the eastern
desert, and may therefore not be controlled by the
decadence of ordinary Egyptian work between the
Old and Middle Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Whether other strange works in black granite&mdash;such
as the fish-offerers of Tanis&mdash;belong to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
age, has been questioned. It may be noted, however,
that the sphinxes and the black granite bust from
Alexandria have a large lachrymal fossa, while the
fish-offerers have no fossa, but only an inner angle
to the eye. The so-called Hyksos figures from
Bubastis are not really of this type, but show an inheritance
of some of its characters, such as belong
to the royal family in the XIIth dynasty. Whenever
the royal portraiture of the XIIth dynasty is
fully collected and studied, it will be possible to clear
the attribution of many statues, and so to separate
those which really belong to the earlier stock.</p>

<p>On coming to the XVIIIth dynasty a more mechanical
style prevails (<a href="#fig36">figs. 36-39</a>). This is obvious
in the formal raised band of eyebrow, and the eyes
being brought forward to the plane of the forehead.
The lips remain more natural, and are still treated
expressively. The best work of this age is the green
basalt statue of Tahutmes III in Cairo (<a href="#fig36">fig. 37</a>). It
accords closely with another figure of black granite
of the same king; but the red granite head in the
British Museum is much coarser and less expressive,
as is natural from that school of granite work. The
large nose is vouched for as a family characteristic
in the reliefs of Tahutmes II and Hatshepsut at
Deir el Bahri, which have precisely the same outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of brow and nose; the under-side of the nose,
the slightly rising curve of the lips to the outer
corner, and the flatness of the facing of the lips, seem
to be individual details.</p>

<p>The head <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a> is of an official of Amenhotep
III, in quartzite. It has a fairly good outline of
the cheek, and well-cut lips; and it shows the more
florid and romantic turn of this age in the wavy hair
marked out with lines.</p>

<p>Under Akhenaten (<a href="#fig36">fig. 39</a>) there came a revolution
of art, which was perhaps only a culmination of
the naturalistic tendencies that were growing during
the preceding reigns. But it was enforced and
supported by the surrounding changes in religion,
ethics, and politics which were carried out by the
humanist reformer who ruled. It was probably also
stimulated by the influence of the contemporary art
of Crete and Greece, the whole eastern Mediterranean
apparently sharing in a general movement.
We shall notice this further when considering reliefs
and painting. Of round sculpture the best figure
remaining is that of Akhenaten now in Paris (<a href="#fig36">fig.
39</a>). It has been part of a group of the king and
queen sitting together, and it shows all the characteristics
of this school in the best form. The eyes
are quite natural; the lips are emphasised by a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
edge along their borders; the jaw and neck are
excellently rendered; and the ear, with its large
pierced lobe, is clearly true to life.</p>

<p>Though the reforms of Akhenaten mostly perished
with him, yet the training of his artists is still to be
seen in the sculpture of Tut-ankh-amen (<a href="#fig36">fig. 38</a>).
This has not the professional completeness of style
seen under Tahutmes III (<a href="#fig36">fig. 37</a>), but it carries on
the less precise sentimentalism of Akhenaten (<a href="#fig36">fig.
39</a>), with much feeling for expression and beauty,
but a lack of grip and force. The brow is neglected,
the eye is feeble, the cheek is without detail, but
the lips and chin are enforced as far as possible.
The whole effect is sweet but not impressive.</p>

<p>We now turn to the minor work in wood. In
the Old Kingdom, wood was frequently carved on
a large scale; of the Middle Kingdom there is the
statue of King Hor; but under the New Kingdom
the only large figures are some rather coarse funeral
statues. On the other hand, in small figures there
is a profusion of wood-carving. The wooden <i>ushabtis</i>
are often beautifully treated; the draped
figures of women are graceful and dignified, with
minute working of the hair and dress; the grotesque
figures of toilet objects are full of character; but
here our space limits us to one class, and we give
the nude figures (<a href="#fig40">figs. 40-42</a>), as such are rarely
found in other material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The little negress (<a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>), carved in ebony, is
part of a group representing her carrying a tray,
which is supported by a monkey before her. But
these accessories are inferior, and merely hide the
figure; the edge of the tray has been slightly cut
in on the breast and thus disfigured it. The detail
of this statuette is better than any other such work;
the perfect pose of the attitude, the poise of the
head, the fulness of the muscles, the innocent gravity
of the expression, are all excellent.</p>

<p>Other figures are carved in the handles of toilet
trays. The girl in <a href="#fig40">fig. 41</a> holding flowers and birds
is on a smaller and coarser scale than the preceding,
but is excellent in expression and in the modelling
of the trunk. The damsel playing a lute on her
boat amid the papyrus thicket (<a href="#fig40">fig. 42</a>) shows one
of the graceful adjuncts of water-parties in high life.
The length of leg is exaggerated to harmonise with
the long stems around; but the pose is skilfully
seized, the distance of the feet being needful for
balance in a little shallop, while the cling of the
thighs is maintained. There is more self-consciousness
and deliberate effect in this expression than
in that of the little girls seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The age of decadence now begins with the Ramessides.
One fine piece arrests us in the black
granite statue of Ramessu II (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>), of which an
entire view is given in <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>. The whole pose is
fairly good, the face looking down toward the spectator
below. The king is no longer the dignified
organiser of the Old Kingdom, with a vision far
away beyond everyday matters, but he is obviously
considering the opinion of the man in front of him.
The detail is almost equal to that of the previous
dynasty; the eye is natural, the nose rather formal,
the lips with the sharp edge even more developed
than before, and the chin and throat less modelled.
The elbow is carefully wrought, bringing out the
fold of flesh and the muscle separately, the accuracy
of which is questionable.</p>

<p>A good example of a private sculpture is the head
of Bak-en-khonsu (<a href="#fig43">fig. 44</a>). The eye is only slightly
indicated, leaning to the conventional blocking out
seen in figs. <a href="#fig88">91</a> and <a href="#fig135">137</a>. The profile is good, and
the lips are less exaggerated than in the royal statues.
The artist could give all his attention to the
face alone, as the figure is entirely hidden in an
almost cubic block, which represents the man seated
with knees drawn up before the chest.</p>

<p>The head of Merenptah (<a href="#fig43">fig. 45</a>) shows him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
inheriting and imitating his father’s face and attitude.
The style is cold and formal; the eyes are
so forward as to be even beyond the plane of the
forehead, and scarcely capped by the brow. But
the nose and lips are natural and free of the forcing
which is seen rather earlier. There is no attempt
at any delicacy of facial curves, and the chin and
throat are masked by the official beard. As this is
in gray granite, and was executed as the <i>ka</i> statue
of the king’s personal temple, it may be taken as
the best that could be done at that time.</p>

<p>A different feeling comes in with the massive
individual portrait of Taharqa (<a href="#fig43">fig. 46</a>). The facial
muscles are strongly marked, but the mouth is singularly
unformed, and is exactly the opposite of that
in the strong type of <a href="#fig32">fig. 34</a>. The eyes are of the
gibbous form, with a long slot of lachrymal fossa,
which is also shown in the kindred figure of Queen
Amenardys (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>). The style is not akin to any
other Egyptian work, and it seems as if an entirely
different physiognomy had challenged the sculptor
and made him drop his usual treatment and
study Nature afresh.</p>

<p>The alabaster statue of Amenardys (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>) is
disproportioned as a whole, though parts are good
separately. It has just the faults due to an imitator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
who does not trust to observation. The head
is too large, the jointing is weak. Each of the
features is fairly well rendered; and within the
limits of later mannerism there is no forcing or
exaggeration.</p>

<p>The portrait of Mentu-em-hat (<a href="#fig47">fig. 48</a>) belongs to
the same style as that of Taharqa, and both are in
black granite. The eyes seem too small, but this
is rather due to the depth and massiveness of the
jaws, which overweight the face. The apparent disproportion
in the low forehead is only due to the
photograph being taken too close and low down.
The height above the eyes is really equal to that
down to the upper edge of the chin. The facial
curves are carefully observed, and we can well credit
this with being a true portrait of the capable governor
of Thebes who continued in office under Taharqa
and Tanut-amen, and who repaired the devastations
of the Assyrian invasion.</p>

<p>A head broken from a statue, found at Memphis
(<a href="#fig47">fig. 49</a>), is remarkable for the deep and searching
modelling. The bony structure, the facial muscles,
and the surface folds are all scrupulously observed.
The artist’s triumph is shown in the harmony and
the living character which he has infused into his
laborious precision. Very rarely can a man rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
superior to such a rigorous training. The character
of work is scarcely Egyptian; it belongs rather to
the same school as the republican Roman portraits,
but is earlier than those, as it has more precision of
detail.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have one of the best examples of Greek
influence in Egypt shown by the wood-carving of
a coffin (<a href="#fig47">fig. 50</a>). The long narrow face shaded by
thick wavy hair is Greek in feeling, while the feather
head-dress is old Egyptian. Unfortunately, the
decay of the wood has broken the surface, but it
still remains an impressive example of Egyptian
influence on art which is mainly Greek.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RELIEFS</span></h2>

<p>In reliefs the representation of Nature is complicated
by the inevitable use of some conventions,
and some kind of perspective, to reduce solid objects
to a plane delineation. It follows that for the
study of naturalistic art they are inferior to statuary,
though they give rise to a whole system of artistic
conventions which are of interest in themselves.
It appears that among most races drawings precede
reliefs, and hence relief must be looked on as
developed drawing, and not as trammelled statuary.</p>

</div>

<p>The oldest reliefs are those of the prehistoric
ivory carvings (see <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), in which we see maintained
the pictorial convention of crossing lines to
substantiate the outline of a solid body, although
the body was now expressed by the relief. A large
quantity of ivory reliefs showing rows of animals
were found at Hierakonpolis, belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
earliest historic times. Of the same class are the
reliefs upon the primitive figures from Koptos (<a href="#fig51">fig.
51</a>). These comprise the elephant, stag’s head, and
swordfish, as well as the hyaena and ox. The design
is spirited, and seizes the characteristics of the
animals; while hills are conventionally shown by
lumps under each foot. The method of work is by
bruising out the surface with a pointed stone pick
around the outline, and so lowering the surrounding
ground (here shaded), while the body of the
animal remains of the original face of the stone.</p>

<p>The next stage is that of the astonishing slate
reliefs. The purely artistic motive is seen in the
group of two long-necked gazelles with a palm-tree
(<a href="#fig51">fig. 52</a>). The detail of the forms of the joints and
the general pose of the animals is excellent, and
the feeling for the graceful, slender outline and
smooth surfaces is enforced by the rugged palm
stem placed between the gazelles. The love of the
strange and wild elements is seen in the rout of
animals, real and mythical, in <a href="#fig51">fig. 53</a>, which shows
the lion, giraffe, wild ox, and many kinds of deer,
well known to the early artists.</p>

<p>The figure of King Narmer (<a href="#fig51">fig. 54</a>) is the historical
point in these slate carvings. As it is more
advanced in style than any of the others, it shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that they all belong to the age just before the Ist
dynasty, about 5500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Here the pose and jointing
are excellent, and the muscles are proclaimed
by the artist as the results of his observation. The
later Egyptian canon is observed that a straight line
should pass through the middle of the head, middle
of the trunk, point of the backward knee, and middle
between the heels: only, as the king is here leaning
forward in action, the line is not vertical as it
is in later standing figures. The facial characters
of the king and his foe are well distinguished; altogether
five different types of race are shown on
these early carvings. The surface of the slate has
been worked down with a metal scraper, shown by
the parallel grooves in the face.</p>

<p>On reaching the beginning of the pyramid age
the finest work is seen in the three wooden panels
of Ra-hesy (<a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>, <i>frontispiece</i>). The anatomy is
full, though not so excessive as in the earlier work.
The facial curves are carefully rendered, and the
mouth is excellently formed. The eye is of course
placed in front view, as it always was by Egyptians.
The whole figure has an air of stark vigour, which
is fitting to a high official who managed a dozen
different offices.</p>

<p>The multitude of the mastaba tomb-chapels of
the pyramid age contain so many thousands of
scenes, illustrating every act of life of men and
animals, that it is impossible to give any view of
their variety. Here we can only give two scenes
illustrating composition. In <a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a> is a group of
men dragging down an ox for sacrifice. The arrangement
of the lines is clear, each figure stands
out separately, the action is vigorous and simple.
Another scene of an ox-herd (<a href="#fig56">fig. 57</a>) shows quiet
motion, with the unusual turning of the head. This
might be thought unnatural, but exactly the same
twist of the body may be seen among Egyptians
now. This style of relief deteriorated in the VIth
dynasty, and then continuously decayed until the
middle of the XIth dynasty, by which time it has
reached a most degraded state.</p>

<p class="caption">57. The ox-herd</p>

</div>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the XIth dynasty,
a new style of careful elaboration begins to appear,
a true archaic germ of a new school. This rapidly
grew, until at the later part of that dynasty there is
a stiff and over-elaborate style, which is well shown
in the figure of the princess Kauat having her hair
curled (<a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>). The eyes of all the figures are gibbous,
with a moderate fossa; the lips have usually
a sharp edge, though sometimes merely rounded;
and there is the beginning of facial modelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In the XIIth dynasty the surface modelling became
elaborate, most delicate gradations being
wrought with faint outlines, as seen in the Memphite
head, <a href="#fig3">fig. 6</a>. A bold high relief and simpler
treatment was followed by the Theban school, as
in <a href="#fig58">fig. 59</a> of the god Ptah and Senusert I embracing.
The use of sunk relief, as <a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>, was as early
as the IVth dynasty, though most of the tomb sculptures
are in high relief. Sunk relief became commoner
in the Middle Kingdom, and almost universal
in the New Kingdom. It saved a large amount
of labour, and it protected the sculptures from injury;
but it is so forcible a convention that it is
never so pleasing as the raised work.</p>

</div>

<p>The XVIIIth dynasty opens with another revival
of art, but yet it never reached the levels of
the earlier ages. The profusion of reliefs of Thebes
and other great sites has made the style of the
XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties the most familiar
to us, but its inferiority to that of the previous periods
is more obvious the more it is studied. The
sculptures of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri are celebrated,
yet the detail in <a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a> is not rich. There
is scarcely any modelling of face or muscles, mere
flat surfaces sufficing; there is but little expression
in the features; and the whole effect is flat and
tame. More character appears under Amenhotep
III (<a href="#fig60">fig. 61</a>), though even here there is none of the
muscular detail which was constantly shown in early
work. The features smile gracefully without any
real expression, and the trivial details of dress are
worked out to give a picturesque elaboration. The
taste for mere prettiness and graceful personalities
ruled more and more as the XVIIIth dynasty
developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">61. Servant of Kha-em-hat</p>

<p class="caption">62. Akhenaten and queen</p>

</div>

<p>At last this taste, stimulated by the influence of
the Greek art and its love of expressing motion,
broke all bounds in the movement under Akhenaten.
The example in <a href="#fig60">fig. 62</a> gives the essence of Atenism.
The natural but ungainly attitudes, the flourishing
ribands, the heavy collars and kilt, the ungraceful
realism of the figures, the loss of all expression and
detail of structure,&mdash;all these show the death of a
permanent art in the fever of novelty and vociferation.</p>

<p>This ferment being passed, the Egyptian went
back on his older style; but it had lost its life, it
could only be copied. The exquisite smoothness
and finish of the good work of Sety I at Abydos
is entirely lifeless and destitute of observation. It
has no anatomical detail, but was made by well-constructed
human machines who could not express an
emotion which they did not feel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The historical scenes of the great sculptures of
Karnak are full of interest, but almost destitute of
art. Some parts of the work of Ramessu III at
Medinet Habu show more observation, such as
the hunting scene, <a href="#fig63">fig. 63</a>. The wild bulls are well
studied, and the marsh-plants with feathery tops
show a real appreciation of natural growth and
beauty.</p>

<p>Under the XXVIth dynasty came the deliberate
imitation of the work of the Old Kingdom. In
a few cases this is passably done, and even some
invention may be seen. But in general there is only
a lifeless imitation of various parts clumsily put together.
One of the best pieces of such art is the
procession of youths and maids carrying animals
and farm produce (<a href="#fig63">fig. 64</a>). The forms are true,
there is none of the later exaggeration (as in <a href="#fig7">fig.
10</a>), and there is a loving touch in the details,
especially of the animals, which belongs to the true
artist. Observe how the girls carry the flowers and
the birds, while the boys take the heavy loads of
papyrus stems and a calf and a basket of flour.
Such work is the last flicker of Egyptian art in
reliefs, and nothing later claims our notice.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PAINTING AND DRAWING</span></h2>

<p>Painting is certainly the earliest art of Egypt;
but, being more perishable than sculpture, many
periods of it are hardly represented at present. A
very early prehistoric vase, painted with white slip
on the red ground, shows the crude figures of two
men fighting (<a href="#fig65">fig. 65</a>). Other such vases have plants
and other objects painted. From the middle of the
prehistoric age, belonging to the second civilisation,
are the light-brown vases painted in red, with figures
of ships and people (<a href="#fig65">fig. 66</a>), plants, and imitations
of stone and wicker patterns. The joints are
fairly correct in the men and animals, though deficient
in the woman with raised arms. But the whole
air is very crude as compared with the roughest
efforts of the dynastic race. Another painting rather
later in the prehistoric age is the ship from a tomb
fresco (<a href="#fig65">fig. 67</a>). The arms of the woman are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
correctly drawn as straight, but the men are worse
posed than in the earlier work. The idea of the
figures seen above the ships, but entirely detached
from them, may be that they are seen on the opposite
bank of a narrow river, beyond the ships.</p>

<p>The advanced painting of the early pyramid
times is shown by the geese (<a href="#fig65">fig. 68</a>), stalking along
in a meadow amid tufts of herbage. The air of grave
self-sufficiency is admirably caught, and this small
piece of a great wall-scene at Medum is deservedly
admired. Of the Middle Kingdom there is no fine
example remaining.</p>

</div>

<p>The great age of painting was the XVIIIth and
XIXth dynasties. The sculpturing of tombs was
then abandoned in favour of the cheaper paint; and
the taste of the age for graceful and light treatment
found its best scope in the use of the brush. Here
we have a group of pelicans (<a href="#fig69">fig. 69</a>) with an old
herdsman and baskets of eggs. Next (<a href="#fig69">fig. 70</a>) is a
harvest scene. Two men are carrying a load of the
ears of corn in a net. Behind are the stalks of straw
after the ears have been cut. Two girls who were
gleaning have stopped to quarrel over the corn; one
has seized a wrist of the other, and the two free hands
have each taken a grip of the other one’s hair.
To the right, under a sycamore fig-tree, one boy
is asleep, while another plays on a long reed pipe,
with a water-skin hung over his head. In the lower
line a girl with a thorn in her foot is stretching it
out to be examined by another girl. Further, a lad
is stripping the heads of millet by dragging them
through a fixed fork. The whole scene is full of
incident, and the drawing of the figures in unusual
action is excellent. The curious dress of the men
is a linen waist-cloth, with a net of slit leather-work
to take the wear, and a solid piece of leather left in
the middle of it for sitting on, as in <a href="#fig139">fig. 140</a>. Such
slit leather-work is dealt with in the last chapter.</p>

<p class="caption">70, 71. Harvest scenes</p>

</div>

<p>A third scene (<a href="#fig69">fig. 71</a>) is in the harvest field;
the ears have been put into a net, and to press them
down a stick is passed through a hole on one edge,
while a man has hooked his arm over the stick, and
jumped up so as to bring his weight with a jerk to
press the stick down; with his other hand he holds
the end of a cord tied to the net, so as to be ready to
secure the stick when pressed down and prevent it
springing up again. The spirit shown in this action
is very good, and it is perhaps the only figure given
in the act of jumping. On the left is a young woman,
one of the daughters, behind the owner of the tomb;
on the right is a gleaning girl, stopping in the tall
corn to drink, with her basket set on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>On the next plate a portion of a ceiling pattern
(<a href="#fig72">fig. 72</a>) shows how such designs were drawn. The
rhombic lines were done first, then the dark groundwork,
leaving white discs, and lastly these were filled
up with the spirals. The whole was copied from
<i>appliqué</i> leather-work, with lines of stitching.</p>

<p>A boating scene (<a href="#fig72">fig. 73</a>) shows the beautifully
bold, clean lines of the drawing, for which in this
case there does not seem to have been any preliminary
sketch of position. The crouching girl picking
a lotus bud from the water is very unusual. The
drawing of wavy water-lines, with lotus flowers, is
the general convention, and the figures of fish and
birds are often seen.</p>

<p>A scene at a party (<a href="#fig72">fig. 74</a>) shows the guests
seated on the ground holding lotus flowers, while a
serving-girl stretches forward to arrange the earrings
of one of the guests.</p>

<p class="caption">74. A party</p>

</div>

<p>Painting received a great stimulus under Akhenaten:
the new movement suited the brush much
better than the chisel. The two figures of the princesses
(<a href="#fig75">fig. 76</a>) show possibilities which were not
then fully carried out. The conventional attitudes
are dropped, and the actual positions of two little
girls are carefully copied. The elder is seated on a
cushion, with the knees drawn up, and resting one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
arm on the knee, while with the other hand she
pushes up her little sister’s chin. The younger has
none of this self-possession, but is propping herself
up with one arm, while she clings to her elder’s
shoulder with the other. The drawing is free and
true, within the usual conventions of perspective.
Further, the colouring has shade on the backs of the
figures, and a high light on the thigh of the younger
daughter. Such shade does not appear in Greek
art till a thousand years later. The pattern in front
is the border of the carpet on which the queen was
seated, her foot and drapery appearing above.</p>

<p>A surprising drawing which belongs to the same
school of observation is the tumbler (<a href="#fig75">fig. 75</a>). Here
an acrobatic position is so skilfully drawn as to
suggest its truth and to avoid any impossibility.
The form of each part is admirable; and if we trace
it piece by piece into an upright position, the resulting
figure is correctly proportioned, except in the
length of the arms. In reality such an attitude requires
the hands to rest on the finger-tips where the
wrist now is drawn. As a drawing of a violent attitude
this is a marvellous work, not only for the
directness and perfection of the line, but also for the
complete lightness and swing of the whole figure.</p>

<p>Another good piece of action is the man (<a href="#fig77">fig. 77</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who is standing on a boat’s cabin hauling in a rope.
The dead-weight of the body is well thrown back;
and as the base is small, one leg is kept in reserve
behind so as to recover any slip. The dead pull,
with both feet planted together and the whole body
rigidly leaning back, is often drawn in the early
fishing scenes; but such an attitude would be unsafe
when standing on the top of a narrow cabin.</p>

</div>

<p>We now turn to outline drawing, in which the
Egyptians always had a grand facility. There is
no instance, even in degraded times, of an outline
made as in modern work by little tentative touches
feeling the way. If they made a mistake, they at
least “sinned splendidly.” The long free strokes,
always taking the whole length of a bone at once,
and often going down a whole figure without raising
the hand&mdash;even, true, without a quiver or hesitation&mdash;shame
most modern outlines. The group of
heads (<a href="#fig77">fig. 78</a>) shows well the amount of character
given by a simple outline. The furthest is a negro,
the next a Syrian, the third an Abyssinian, the last
a Libyan. The type of each is shown with zest and
energy, and the line-work could not be improved.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#fig77">fig. 79</a> is a very rough sketch for a little tablet
of adoration. It shows the faint outlines in red
which were laid in first to space out the figure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Such were used in nearly all cases as a preliminary
guide; but they were freely improved on in the final
black drawing, as here the whole base has been
lowered. This also shows the sketch-forms of hieroglyphic
writing.</p>

<p>The final work for a royal tomb is seen in <a href="#fig77">fig. 80</a>,
Sety I offering to Osiris. We can here admire the
perfect freedom and exactitude of the handling,
although this was only intended as a guide to the
sculptor, and was not to be finally visible.</p>

<p>A large branch of drawing which we have not
space to illustrate here is that of the papyri and
hieroglyphs. The papyri show the clear, fine outlines
in the good examples. In later times, rough
as the work may be, the feeling for expression never
deserts the artist. The hieroglyphs form a great
study by themselves. The sources of the signs, the
various treatment of them, the minute details introduced,
are all full of interest. The great result was
that the Egyptian had a writing which, though
cumbrous, was a continual pleasure to see, and
which adorned the artistic monuments on which it
was placed.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ARCHITECTURE</span></h2>

<p>Strange to say, Egyptian architecture has never
yet been systematically studied; we know nothing
of its proportions and variations.</p>

<p>The earliest constructions were of brick, or of
palm-sticks interwoven. From the necessary forms
of these all the details of the stone architecture have
been copied. A parallel is seen in Greece, where the
architecture was an exact transcription of a wooden
building, the triglyphs, mutules, and guttae being
the beam-ends, tie-boards, and pegs formerly belonging
to woodwork.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="250" height="125" alt="A brick wall with concave bed (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>For the greater security of the corners of brick
buildings, the Egyptians
tilted the courses up at each
end, thus building in a concave
bed, with faces sloping
inwards. This slope was
copied in the stone-work, and is seen on the outsides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of all Egyptian buildings (see <a href="#fig81">fig. 83</a>). The inside
faces are always vertical, and this serves to distinguish
the meaning of small portions of wall in
excavations.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_063a.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Palm-stick structure (drawing)" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/i_063b.jpg" width="120" height="200" alt="Cavetto cornice (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>Slight structures were made of palm-sticks, set
upright, and lashed to a cross stick
near the top, with other palm-sticks
interwoven to stiffen the face, and
the whole plastered with mud.
Such construction is made now in
Egypt, and is seen in the earliest
figures of shrines. At the top the
ends of the palm-sticks nod over, and form a fence
to keep out intruders. This row of tops is the
origin of the stone cavetto cornice, which always
stands free above the level of the roof.
At the corners the structure of palm-stick
was strengthened by a bundle of
sticks or reeds lashed round, and put as
a buffer to prevent a blow breaking in
the edge. This became the roll with
lashing pattern which is seen down the edges of
the stone buildings, and also beneath the cavetto
cornice where it is copied from the line of sticks
below the loose tops (see <a href="#fig81">fig. 83</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Papyrus stems and resulting wall ornament (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>Another form of construction was with papyrus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stems. These had a loose, wiry head like an <i>Equisetum</i>
or mare’s tail. When used for a cabin on a
boat, the roofing stems were put through the loose
head, which was tied above and below to hold them.
Hence the row of heads became copied as an ornament
along the tops of walls, and continued in use
thus down to the latest times.</p>

<p>The use of the arch was familiar from early times.
Even before the pyramid-builders small arches of
bricks were made. They were the general mode of
roofing in the XIIth dynasty, when we see them
drawn and imitated in stone. From the XIXth
dynasty there remain the great arched store-rooms
of the Ramesseum. Being of dried mud brick,
which is far more easily crushed than stone or burnt
brick, the circular form was not suitable, as the apex
would yield by crushing. A more or less parabolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
form was therefore used, so as to give a sharper
curve at the top. To protect these arches from the
weather, they were laid four courses thick, with a
deep layer of sand and gravel over the top, to absorb
any rain as a sponge.</p>

<p>Arches were usually built without any centring;
and to this day the Egyptian similarly builds arches
and domes of any size without centring or support.
Each ring of arch is laid on a sloping bed, so that
the thin arch bricks on edge will stick in place by
the mud-mortar until the ring is completed. The
same construction is started in each corner of a
room until the arching meets in a circle, when the
dome is carried round ring on ring, increasing the
dip toward the top. The successive coats of an
arch are often bedded on opposite slopes, so that
the rings cross each other.</p>

<p>The outer form of a temple was always a blank
wall on all sides, as at Edfu, which preserves its
circuit wall complete. Usually the outer wall has
been removed for building (<a href="#fig81">fig. 83</a>), and the inner
courts with columns are exposed. In further ruin all
the walls of squared blocks are gone, and only a
group of pillars is left on the site.</p>

<p>A typical building of the early age is the temple
of red granite built by Khafra at Gizeh (<a href="#fig81">fig. 81</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The pillars are 41 inches square, and there are
sixteen of them in the two halls. The work is perfectly
plain; not a trace of ornament is to be seen
in this or other temples of the IIIrd-IVth dynasties.
Only on the outside was there a panelling, like that
on the brick buildings and stone sarcophagi of this
age. The masonry of this temple is much less
exact than that of the early pyramids. The whole
effect of it is grand and severe, with the noble
breadth which belongs to the early times.</p>

<p>The tower front of the temple at Medinet Habu
(<a href="#fig81">fig. 82</a>) is one of the few façades that is preserved.
It was copied from the Syrian fortresses, and shows
how the Asiatic influences had entered Egypt during
the three centuries from about 1500 to 1200 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The most complete view of a whole temple is
that of Dakkeh (<a href="#fig81">fig. 83</a>). The girdle wall has been
destroyed, thus exposing the components of the
temple clearly. At the left is the great pylon, the
gateway through the girdle wall. This led to the
portico, which was the front of the house of the god,
like the porticoes to human houses. Behind this a
cross passage, of which the door is seen at the side,
passed in front of the shrine and its ante-chamber.
This was one of the most perfect small temples,
but it has been much destroyed in recent years.</p>

<p class="caption">86. Blue lotus</p>

</div>

<p>The massive square pillars of the granite temple
gave place before long to more ornamental forms.
The principal types are the palm and lotus in the
Vth dynasty, and later the papyrus. The palm
capital is shown on the granite columns of Unas
(<a href="#fig84">fig. 84</a>). It was probably derived from a bundle
of palm-sticks bound together and plastered with
mud to stiffen them, like the bundles of maize-stalks
which are still used for columns. Around the
top of it some of the loose ends of the palm-sticks
were left with the leaves to form a head.</p>

<p>The lotus capital appears likewise as a shaft decorated
with buds around it (<a href="#fig84">fig. 85</a>). In this case
the buds are the short, thick ones of the rose lotus,
with flowers of the blue lotus put in the intervals
under the abacus. But the lotus bud soon became
treated as a solid support, and in the capital of the
blue lotus (<a href="#fig84">fig. 86</a>) the whole is formed of four lotus
buds. The bands of the tie were always strongly
marked, however changed the capital might become
in later time. The papyrus column belongs mainly
to the XIXth dynasty, as in the great hall of Karnak.
It was the most incongruous of all, as a single
gigantic head of loose filaments was represented as
supporting the whole weight.</p>

<p>Plain polygonal shafts were also common. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
octagonal ones occur in the Vth dynasty. In the
XIIth dynasty they are sixteen-sided, keeping
the four main faces flat and slightly hollowing the
others. This was continued in the earlier part of
the XVIIIth dynasty, but after that the polygonal
form almost disappears.</p>

<p>Here we can only touch on some of the artistic
elements; the architecture as a whole is beyond
the scope of so small a volume.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STONE-WORKING</span></h2>

<p>We here begin to deal with the more technical
rather than the purely artistic view&mdash;the crafts as
well as the arts. Connected with the last chapter
is the study of the materials and methods used for
the architecture.</p>

<p>Limestone was the main material of the land, the
Eocene cliffs fencing in the Nile valley along four
hundred miles. The two finest kinds are the Mokattam
stone opposite the pyramids, which is perfectly
uniform and free from splitting or flaws; and
the hard silicified stone occurring at Tell el Amarna
and elsewhere. The next commonest material was
soft sandstone from Silsileh, used generally after
the middle of the XVIIIth dynasty, especially in
the Thebaid. The less usual stones are the red
granite of Aswan, which was used from the Ist
dynasty onwards; the quartzite sandstone of Gebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Ahmar near Cairo, begun on a large scale by the
XIIth dynasty; basalt from Khankah and other
eruptions, used in the IVth and XIXth dynasties;
alabaster from the quarries near Tell el Amarna;
and diorite, used by the pyramid builders only.</p>

<p>The quarrying of the limestone was usually by
large galleries run into the best strata. Blocks of
two or three feet in size were cut out by picking a
trench wide enough for the arm to pass downward
around the block, and then inward below it, until
it could be cracked away from the bed. The blocks
were thus cut out in regular rows, from top to
bottom of the gallery face. The same method is
still kept up in the open-air quarry at Helwan. For
larger blocks a trench eighteen inches wide, in which
the workman could pass, was cut around the block.
In the sandstone quarries the same mode of cutting
was followed, only the quarry was open to the sky.
So carefully was inferior stone rejected, that instead
of following cracks in the rock, a wall of stone was
left on each side of a crack; and such walls, each
containing a fissure, divide the quarry to its whole
depth.</p>

<p>The granite was first obtained from loose water-worn
blocks at the Cataract, a great advantage of
such a source being that any cracks are made visible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Later it was quarried in the bed; a large mass
still in the quarry has been trimmed and marked
across to be cut up for shrines or sarcophagi. The
early mode of fissuring was by cutting a groove
and jumping holes through the thickness of the
stone, to determine the direction of the fissure.
Probably the active force was dried wood driven in
and wetted, as there is no trace of bruising by
metal wedges on the sides of the groove. In later
times, instead of holes, mere pockets were sunk
rather deeper in the groove to hold the splitting
agent.</p>

<p>For cutting passages or chambers in rock, the
method was to make a rough drift-way, then finish a
true plane for the roof, next mark an axis upon the
roof plane, trim the sides true to the distance from a
plumb bob held at the axis, and finally smooth the
floor to a uniform distance from the roof. In a rock
chamber the roof was finished first, and a shaft was
sunk to the intended depth of the chamber to mark
it out.</p>

<p>The surfaces of rock and of dressed stones were
picked smooth by a short adze, with cuts crossing
in all directions. The edges of a stone were first
dressed true, and then the space between was referred
to the edges. To do this, two offset sticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with a string stretched between the tops of them
were stood on the edges, and a third offset was used
to test the depth to the face, so as to see how much
was to be cut away. For larger stones, a diagonal
draft-line was cut true as well as the edge drafts, so
as to avoid any twist. The face was finally tested
with a portable plane smeared with red ochre, and
wherever that left a touch of red, the stone was
cut down; this was continued until the red touched
at intervals of not more than an inch. This was the
quality of face for joints; but it was further smoothed
by grinding on outer finished surfaces. The rough
hewing of rock tombs was generally done with mauls
of silicified limestone, which is found as nodules left
on the surface.</p>

<p>The granite and hard stones were also sawn, and
cut with tubular drills. The saws were blades of
copper, which carried the hard cutting points. The
cutting material was sand for working the softer
stones, and emery for harder rocks. As far back as
prehistoric times, blocks of emery were used for
grinding beads, and even a plummet and a vase were
cut out of emery rock (now in University College).
There can be no doubt, therefore, of emery being
known and used.</p>

<p>The difficult question is whether the cutting material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was used as loose powder, or was set in the
metal tool as separate teeth. An actual example was
found at the prehistoric Greek palace of Tiryns.
The hard limestone there has been sawn, and I
found a broken bit of the saw left in a cut. The
copper blade had rusted away to green carbonate;
and with it were some little blocks of emery about
a sixteenth of an inch long, rectangular, and quite
capable of being set, but far too large to act as a
loose powder with a plain blade. On the Egyptian
examples there are long grooves in the faces of the
cuts of both saws and drills; and grooves may be
made by working a loose powder. But, further, the
groove certainly seems to run spirally round a core,
which would show that it was cut by a single point;
and where quartz and softer felspar are cut through
the groove floor runs on one level, and as the felspar
is worn down by general rubbing, the quartz is
actually cut through to a greater depth than the
softer felspar. This shows that a fixed cutting point
ploughed the groove, and not a loose powder. Also,
the hieroglyphs on diorite bowls are ploughed out
with a single cut of a fixed point, only one hundred
and fiftieth of an inch wide, so it is certain that fixed
cutting points were used for hand-graving. There
is no doubt that sawing and grinding with loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
powder was the general method, but the use of fixed
stones seems clearly shown by the instances above.</p>

<p>The large hieroglyphs on hard stones were cut
by copper blades fed with emery, and sawn along
the outline by hand; the block between the cuts
was broken out, and the floor of the sign was hammer-dressed,
and finally ground down with emery.
Hammer-dressing was largely used in all ages on
the hard stones; the blows crushed the stone to
powder, and the stunning of the surface was often
not quite removed by grinding, and shows as white
spots. The hammer was usually of black hornstone,
a tough amorphous quartz rock.</p>

<p>The methods of placing the stones in the building
have been often debated. The foundations were
usually laid on a bed of clean sand, and this enabled
the whole course to be accurately adjusted
level to begin with. For temples, it seems most
likely that the interior was filled with earth as the
building advanced; and thus the walls, drums, and
architraves could be as easily dealt with as on the
lowest course. This plan is successfully used at
Karnak in present repairs. But where stones needed
to be raised for a pyramid or a pylon, some staging
was required. Remains of a massive brick slope
still stand against each face of the unfinished pylons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at Karnak. This, however, is only the general mass
of the staging, and the actual steps for the stones
must have been of stone, as brick would crumble to
powder if any lifting work was done directly upon it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="Cradle of wood for moving blocks (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>For short blocks a cradle of wood was used, of
which many models have been found in foundation
deposits along with model tools. On tilting this to
one end, and putting a wedge beneath it, it could be
rocked up the slope, and so gradually raised, first to
one end and then to the other. For large blocks,
the actual lifting was probably done by rocking up.
If a beam be supported by two piles near the middle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a small force will tilt it up clear of one pile; on
raising that pile the beam may be tilted the other
way, and the lower pile raised in its turn. Thus
rocking from pile to pile, a beam can be quickly
raised till it is high enough to be moved on to the
next step. It was probably thus that the fifty-six
granite beams, weighing over fifty tons each, were
raised in the pyramid of Khufu.</p>

<p>The obelisks were transported on great barges,
as shown in the sculptures. The method of raising
such stones is partly explained by an account of setting
up colossi of Ramessu IV. A causeway of earth
was made sloping up for a length of a quarter of a
mile; it was ninety-five feet wide, and one hundred
and three feet high on the slope, probably about
sixty or seventy feet vertically, as the slopes were
held up steeply with facings of timber and brushwood.
The purpose of this evidently was to raise
the great block by sliding on its side up the slope,
and then to tilt it upright by gravity over the head
of the slope. How the mass would be turned we
have nothing to show, but probably the simplest
way, by gradually removing earth, would be followed.
By next ramming earth beneath the obelisk as it lay
on a slope, it would be quite practicable to force it
forward into an upright position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>After a building was finished the sculpturing of
its walls had to be executed. For this, a long training
of sculptors was needful, and the art schools
filled an important part in education. The simplest
subjects of outlines in limestone were a first step,
the sign <i>neb</i> requiring a straight and a curved line
only. After the geometric forms came studies of
heads and of hands. In <a href="#fig88">fig. 88</a> we see how, after
a fair control of the graver had been attained, there
was still much to be learned in detail and harmony
before the artist could be trusted to decorate a
temple.</p>

<p>Statuary also needed a long training. The work
was first marked out in profile of the front and
sides, and then cut along these outlines, as in the
rock-crystal figure (<a href="#fig88">fig. 89</a>), where the outlines at
right angles have been cut, but the corners are yet
unrounded. In the block for the head of a lion (<a href="#fig88">fig.
90</a>) the various planes have been already cut for
the face, before attempting any rounding. The limestone
head (<a href="#fig88">fig. 91</a>) shows a further stage, where
the general rounding is done, but the details of the
lips, ears, eyes, and eyebrows are yet left in the
block. All of these stages needed incessant practice,
and years must have been spent in training in the
schools before final work was undertaken.</p>

<p>Turning now to stone-work on a smaller scale,
the hardest materials were wrought for vases in
the prehistoric age. In the first civilisation, basalt,
syenite, and porphyry were in use as well as the
softer stones, alabaster and limestone. The later
civilisation brought in slate, coloured limestone,
serpentine, and lastly diorite, which continued to be
the favourite stone into the pyramid age. The main
differences of form are shown in <a href="#fig87">fig. 87</a>. The earlier
type of vase is the standing form F, with a foot, and
no piercing for suspension. The later prehistoric
age brought in the suspended stone as well as pottery
vases. The main types were A, B, D, E, G,
H, and lastly C, cut out of coloured marbles, of
syenite, and of basalt. All of these vases were cut
entirely by hand without any turning, or even any
circular grinding, on the outside. The polish lines
cross diagonally on the curved sides, and the slight
irregularities of form, though imperceptible to the
eye, can be felt by rotation in the fingers. The
greatest triumph of this stone-work is the vase from
Hierakonpolis in black and white syenite, of the type
A, E, two feet across and sixteen inches high, which
is highly polished, and hollowed out so thin that it
can be lifted by one finger, though if solid it would
weigh four hundred pounds. The interior of these
vases was ground out with stone grinders fed with
emery, and in softer stones cut out by crescent-shaped
flint drills.</p>

<p>The historic times show a continual decline in the
quality of the stone used. In the Ist dynasty the
hard stones decreased, and the softer slate and
alabaster were more common. In the pyramid age
only diorite continued in use among the hard materials,
and that but rarely compared to soft stones;
while in the XIIth and XVIIIth dynasties, beyond
an occasional vase of obsidian or serpentine, nothing
is seen but the soft alabaster. The form J belongs
to the VIth dynasty. K is a type which descends
from the Ist dynasty, but in this form wide at the
top belongs to the XIIth, after which it disappears.
L and M are of the XVIIIth dynasty.</p>

<p>Amulets of fine stone were used from prehistoric
days onwards. Of the early ones, the bull’s head is
the commonest, made of carnelian, haematite, or
glazed quartz. The fly is made of slate, lazuli, and
serpentine in prehistoric times, and of gold in historic
jewellery. The hawk is found of glazed quartz
and limestone, the serpent of lazuli and limestone;
the crocodile, the frog, the claw, the spear-head are
all found in prehistoric use. In the Old Kingdom,
small amulets of carnelian or ivory were usual; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
forms are the hand, the fist, the eye, lion, jackal-head,
frog, and bee. In the Middle Kingdom the
more usual material was silver or electrum. The
New Kingdom used amulets but little; the great
profusion comes from the mummies of the Saite
time, when dozens may be found on one body. The
great variety of forms and materials would require
a volume to explain them.</p>

<p>Beads were used from prehistoric times. The hard
stones were cut then&mdash;quartz, amethyst, agate, carnelian,
turquoise, lazuli, haematite, serpentine, as
well as glazes on quartz and on paste. Glazed
pottery beads became the more usual in historic
times; glass beads were made from the XVIIIth
dynasty onward, and hardly any other material was
used in Roman times. There are hundreds of varieties
known, and an accurate knowledge of their
dates is essential in excavating.</p>

<p>Flint was worked to the highest perfection in the
prehistoric age, and continued in use till Roman
times. Strictly, it is chert rather than flint, as the
beds in which it is found are of Eocene limestone.
But in general appearance and nature they are
closely the equivalent of the chalk with flints in
England, only harder. The prehistoric forms are
shown in <a href="#fig92">fig. 92</a>. They exceed the flint-work of all
other countries in the regularity of the flaking, the
thinness of the weapon, and the minute serration
of the edges. At present such work is entirely a
lost art, and we cannot imagine the methods or the
skill required to produce such results. Besides the
weapons, flint armlets were made, chipped out of
a solid block, yet no thicker than a straw. These
were ground with emery finally to smooth them for
wearing. Flint was commonly used down to the
XIIth dynasty for knives, but all the dynastic working
is far inferior to the earlier. In the XVIIIth
dynasty, and later, sickle teeth were still made of
flint; and flakes were chipped and used in abundance
at some centres in the Roman period.</p>

</div>

<p>Before leaving the stone-working we may note
the accuracy of work, as this is better seen here than
in any other subject. The highest pitch of accuracy
on a large scale was reached under Khufu in the
IVth dynasty; his pyramid had an error of less than
·6 of an inch on its side of 9069 inches, or 1 in
15,000; and its corners were square to 12″. A
change of temperature during a day would make
larger errors than this in a measuring-rod. The
accuracy of levelling, and of finish of the stones, is
on a par with this; joints over six feet long are
straight to a hundredth of an inch. The pyramid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of Khafra has three times this error, varying 1·5
inch on 8475, and 33″ of angle. That of Menkaura
is worse, being on an average 3 inches out on
4154, and 1′ 50″ of angle. At Dahshur the errors
are 3·7 on 7459 inches base, and 1·1 on 2065, with
angular errors of 4′ and 10′. In smaller work, a
beautiful example is the granite sarcophagus of
Senusert II, which is ground flat on the sides with
a matt face like ground glass, and only has about
a two-hundredth of an inch error of flatness and
parallelism of the sides. The later ages, so far as we
know, have left nothing that can be compared with
the accuracy of the early dynasties.</p>

<span class="smaller">JEWELLERY</span></h2>

<p>Native gold is, in all countries, one of the earliest
materials for manufactured ornaments, and it appears
to have been much used in prehistoric Egypt.
Though gold is not now sought in or near Egypt,
we must remember that it is found in the stream
deposits of most countries, and its absence from
the Mediterranean lands now is only due to the
ancient workers having exhausted the supply. The
immediate sources of the metal were in Nubia and
Asia Minor. The Asiatic gold was certainly used
in the first dynasty, as it is marked by having a
variable amount of silver alloy, about a sixth; but
looking at the African influence on Egypt it is
probable that Nubia was the first source, though
whether gold (<i>nūb</i>) was called from the country
(<i>nūb</i>), or the reverse, is uncertain.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="150" height="70" alt="Collar of beads / hieroglyph for gold (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>So general was the use of gold for necklaces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that the picture of a collar of beads became the
hieroglyph for gold. Strings of minute
gold beads were worn on the ankles in
prehistoric times (8000-5000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Larger beads
were economically made by beating out a thin tube,
and then drawing down the ends over a core of limestone.
A thin gold finger ring has been found, and
a flat pendant with punched dots. But most of the
prehistoric gold is seen on the lips of stone vases,
overlaying the handles of vases, and forming the
wire loops for carrying them. Similarly it was used
for covering the handles of flint knives; a sheet
of gold was fitted over the flint, embossed with figures
of women, animals, twisted snakes, a boat,
etc. But the use of thin gold leaf which adheres
to its base, is not found until the pyramid times.
At the close of the prehistoric period we meet with
a gold cylinder seal engraved with signs. When
we remember that it is very rarely that an unplundered
grave is discovered, the quantity of gold
objects found show that the metal must have been
generally used in the ages when commerce developed,
before writing was known.</p>

the first dynasty, 5400 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> These bracelets (<a href="#fig93">fig. 93</a>)
show how each separate piece was made to fit its
own place in a complete design, and that the later
custom of merely stringing ready-made beads was
not then followed.</p>

<p>The bracelet of hawks has the gold blocks alternating
with turquoise. The hawks on the gold
pieces are all equal, but the sizes of the blocks vary
in the height. This is due to their being all cast in
the same mould, which was filled to varying amounts.
The surfaces were hammered and chiselled, but not
either ground or filed. The order of the hawks was
marked by numbering them with cross cuts on the
base; these cuts are directly across for the blocks on
one half, and diagonally across for the other half.</p>

<p>The bracelet with spiral beads has the gold spiral
formed of a hammered gold wire, thicker at the
middle, where it forms the barrel of the beads. This
form is imitated in the three dark lazuli beads down
the middle. The triple gold balls, on either side
of those, are each beaten hollow and drawn into a
thread-hole left at each end; so perfectly wrought
are they that only in one instance does the slightest
ruck of metal remain. To join the three balls together
they were soldered, but without leaving the
least excess or difference of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In the lowest bracelet the hour-glass-shaped beads
are of gold, with one of amethyst between each
pair. The gold is doubtless cast, being solid. None
of these are pierced, but they were secured by tying
round a groove at the middle of each bead.
There was also a fourth bracelet with a ball and
loop fastening which shows the skill in soldering.
The ball is beaten hollow, leaving about a quarter
of it open; inside it a hook of gold wire is soldered
in without leaving the smallest trace of solder visible.
The band round the wrist was formed of very
thick black hair plaited with gold wire, which was
hammered to exactly the same thickness. We see
from these bracelets that casting, chiselling, and
soldering were perfectly understood at the beginning
of the monarchy.</p>

<p>Of about the Ist dynasty there are also copies
of spiral shells made by pressing gold foil, perhaps
over shells. These were threaded as a necklace,
imitating the shell necklaces of earlier ages.</p>

<p>On coming to the VIth dynasty (4000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) we
see gold chains (<a href="#fig93">fig. 94</a>) made of rings, each folded
into a double loop and put through the next; these
may be called loop-in-loop chain. Gold seals (<a href="#fig93">fig.
95</a>) are also found, probably made by foreigners and
worn as buttons, like many similar stone buttons.</p>

</div>

<p>The XIIth dynasty has left us some magnificent
groups of jewellery, which were found at Dahshur.
The general effect of this work is graceful and sincere
in design and pure in colour. There is no
glitter and pomp about it, but it has the highest
beauty of careful harmony and perfect finish. The
tints of the carnelian, turquoise, and lazuli which
are used have been precisely chosen for their clear
strength of colour, while the Egyptian system of
putting a line of gold between two bright colours
prevents any dazzling or clashing. The charm of
this jewellery lies in the calm, fresh, cool colouring
with the unhesitating perfection of the work, which
seems to ignore all difficulty or compromise.</p>

<p>Three pectoral ornaments made in successive
reigns are each formed of an open-work gold plate,
engraved on one side and inlaid with coloured stones
on the other. The engraved sides of two are here
given (figs. <a href="#fig97">97</a>, <a href="#fig97">98</a>), as they are better suited for illustration.
The earlier pectoral, bearing the names
of Senusert II, is by far the better in design. The
scheme of the whole is grasped at once, and rests
the eye; there is repose and dignity in it. Although
clear open spaces are left, the parts are sufficiently
connected for strength.</p>

<p>The second pectoral, of Senusert III, is too complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for a single piece of jewellery for the breast.
The heavy mass of the vulture at the top over-weights
the design; the head-dress of the royal
sphinxes is too tall; and the combination of four
captives between the eight legs of the sphinxes, or
twenty-four limbs in action, is far too complex and
distracting. But in the detail we must admire the
expression of the captives; and also the skill with
which the parts are united, especially where the
frail length of the tails is held in by the extra lotus
flowers.</p>

<p>The third pectoral, of Amenemhat III, is the
least successful in design. It is made too large
in order to take in whole figures of the king fighting;
the action is violent; and, not content with
four figures, the outlines are lost in a maze of emblems
which fill all the space around, so that nothing
is clear or restful to the eye. The earliest
pectoral was evidently designed to be seen at a
respectful distance on royalty in movement. To
see the last design the queen would need to be
closely stared at, in order to make out the cumbrous
historical document on her breast.</p>

</div>

<p>Two crowns of gold and inlaid stones belonged
also to the princesses. The floret crown (<a href="#fig99">fig. 100</a>)
is perhaps the most charmingly graceful head-dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ever seen; the fine wavy threads of gold harmonised
with the hair, and the delicate little flowers
and berries seem scattered with the wild grace of
Nature. Each floret is held by two wires crossing
in an eye behind it, and each pair of berries has
likewise an eye in which the wires cross. The florets
are not stamped, but each gold socket is made
by hand for the four inserted stones. The berries
are of lazuli. In no instance, however small, was
the polishing of the stone done in its cloison; it
was always finished before setting.</p>

<p>The upper crown (<a href="#fig99">fig. 99</a>) is less unusual. The
motive is the old one seen on the head-dress of
Nofert (<a href="#fig23">fig. 24</a>); but the flowers have become conventionalised.
The band form is broken by the upright
flowers rising from each rosette; and in front
there was an aigrette of gold with flowers formed
of coloured stones.</p>

<p>Turning now to the technical details, some small
gold lions were cast, but not all from a single
mould. They seem to have been modelled in wax,
and after forming the mould around the model the
wax was melted out, and the metal run in. This
method, known as <i>cire perdue</i>, was usual in later
periods. The details are slightly chiselled upon the
gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Moulding by pressure was used in making cowry
beads and tie beads, which were impressed in stout
foil, aided by burnishing on to the model so as to
tool the detail.</p>

<p>Soldering was done most delicately for the side
joints of the hollow cowry beads; it was also used
on a large scale for the dozens of delicate ribs of
gold which were fixed to the back plates for the
cloison work of the pectorals. To attach this multitude
of minute ribs exactly in place shows most
practised work, for they could not be treated separately,
being so close together.</p>

<p>Wire was made in large quantity for the floret
crown. This wire was all cut in strips, and pieces
soldered together to form a length. The same
method was later used by the Jews: “they did beat
the gold into thin plates and cut it into wires”
(Ex. xxxix. 3). Drawn wire has not been found in
any ancient work. A favourite style of work for
figures of gods and sacred animals in this age was
a mixture of wirework and sheet metal; such amulets
and sacred animals are usually half an inch
high: the example of the sacred cobra here shown
(<a href="#fig93">fig. 96</a>) is by far the finest known.</p>

<p class="caption">101. Granulated gold work (all XIIth dynasty)</p>

</div>

<p>A new decoration which first appears in this age
is that of granulated work (<a href="#fig99">fig. 101</a>). Here it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
seen on a case in a zigzag pattern, and on two pendants.
Another example is a pattern of small rhombs
on the bezel of a ring. The granules are 5 × 5 in
each rhomb, and eight rhombs on the bezel, or forty
granules in about six-tenths of an inch; allowing
for spaces, the granules must be an eightieth of
an inch wide. This kind of work is found also later
on in Egypt, but it may not be native; in Etruria it
was the national type of jewellery about three thousand
years after this.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="150" height="70" alt="Necklace fastener (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>The mode of fastening the necklaces was by
grooved pieces. One of the gold cowries, or lion’s
heads, or ties which formed the necklace, was made
in two halves with dovetail groove and
tongue fitting into each other along the
whole length of the piece. The tongue ran up
against a butt end when the halves coincided.</p>

<p>When we reach the XVIIIth dynasty we see in
the jewellery of Queen Aah-hotep (1570 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) much
the same system of work as in the XIIth dynasty.
The whole style is less substantial, exact, and dignified;
both in design and execution it is at all
points inferior to the previous work. One new art
appears, the plaiting of gold wire chains, in what is
now commonly called Trichinopoly pattern. This
method was continued down to Roman times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Aah-hotep-Aahmes bracelet (<a href="#fig102">fig. 102</a>) is a
broad band of metal, with the figures in raised gold
on a dark blue ground. At first it looks as if enamelled,
as the ground runs in the small intervals
between the gold; but it is really a surface formed
of pieces of dark lazuli, cut approximately to the
forms and patched around with a dark blue paste to
match it. Two other bracelets (or perhaps anklets)
are formed of minute beads of stones and gold
threaded on parallel wires, forming a band about
1½ inches wide. The pattern seems an imitation
of plaiting, as each colour forms a half square divided
diagonally. The necklace of large gold flies
is heavy, and lacks the grace of earlier times. The
axe of Aahmes (<a href="#fig102">fig. 104</a>) is beautifully inlaid with
gold, bearing the king’s names, the figures of the
king smiting an enemy, and the gryphon-sphinx
of the god Mentu. The dagger (<a href="#fig102">fig. 103</a>) has more
of the Mykenaean Greek style in the inlaying of
the blade, with figures of a lion chasing a bull, and
four grasshoppers. The four heads which form
the pommel are unlike any other Egyptian design;
but the squares divided diagonally on the handle
are like the patterns of the bead anklets, and are
probably of Egyptian source.</p>

<p>Of the XIXth dynasty there is the Serapeum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
jewellery, found with the Apis burials. The pectoral
of Ramessu II (<a href="#fig105">fig. 105</a>) is of good design;
the wings of the vulture are boldly spread in wide
curves, and the king’s name is simple, without titles,
and well placed. The border band is heavy, and
the colouring is rich. It is a creditable work, but
entirely missing the grace and sense of perfection
of the best work from Dahshur.</p>

</div>

<p>The gold bracelets with name of Ramessu II
found at Bubastis, are of inferior work, probably for
one of his fifty-nine daughters. The name is only
impressed on stout foil, which is set in a framework
of the bracelet, but the surfaces are ornamented
with gold granular work, showing that such was
commonly used. There is a pair of collar
fasteners, clumsily made by filing the bent
gold and working thread-holes in the cut; there
are thirty-six thread-holes, so the collar must have
been a very wide one. The fastening
by two halves sliding together is made
by two wires soldered in to form the dovetail. In
this same group are thick wire bracelets of
silver, with a coarse hatched pattern on the
ends; also many plain silver earrings, such
as were worn by the common people of this time.</p>

</div>

<p>Slightly later is the jewellery of Sety II and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Tausert from the Kings’ Tombs. Here are also
solid wire bangles, but of gold. And square wire
bangles have the thin tail of each end of the bar
twisted round the stem on the other side, a fastening
also commonly found on finger-rings, of this
age and rather earlier. Some clumsy little open-work
beads are made by rough circles of gold wire
soldered together; a wide equatorial circle is joined
to a small polar circle at each end by six small
circles touching. Flowers are made by stamping
the petals out of foil; there are ten petals to each,
and four of them are stamped with the king’s name.
Some monstrous earrings overloaded with ornament
belong to the end of the Ramessides (<a href="#fig105">fig. 106</a>).</p>

<p>Base gold was much used at the close of the
XVIIIth dynasty, and many of the finger-rings of
that age almost verge into copper. But stones
were used for inlay work until the later Ramessides,
and glass or paste does not become usual till
up to 1000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Enamel fused upon metal is not
known until Roman times.</p>

</div>

<p>In the VIIIth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> gold working was well
maintained, as seen (<a href="#fig105">fig. 107</a>) in the statuette made
by the local king Pafaabast. The modelling of the
limbs is exact, the pose is free, and it shows the
maintenance of a good tradition. About a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
later there is fine cloison work on the gold birds of
the Hawara amulets, as minute as any of earlier
times.</p>

<p>A free use of gold-work comes in with the wealth
of the Ptolemaic age, especially for bracelets and
chains. A usual type of bracelet, in gold or silver,
was with busts of Serapis and Isis on the two ends
of a strip, which were turned up at right angles to
the circle. These are generally of coarse work.
Plain bangles, bracelets with the two tails of a bar
twisted each round the other, coiled wire bracelets
which were elastic, and hingeing bracelets, are all
found in use at this age. Much Greek influence is
seen in the patterns, both now and in the Roman
period. The bangle bracelets were often made
hollow, both for lightness and economy of metal.
Cheaper styles were of thin gold foil worked over
a core of plaster; the decoration of cross lines on
such shows that they are probably Roman. The
chains of Ptolemaic and Roman age (<a href="#fig108">fig. 109</a>) are
simple, but of pleasing style.</p>

<p>In Coptic times bracelets of various forms were
made, mostly of silver and baser metal; but they are
all plain and tasteless. Large earrings were made
with a big hoop and a bunch of small pendants, or
an open-work metal bead. Necklets of silver were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
usual, with the tails of the strip wound round each
other, so as to slide open for passing over the head.</p>

<p>Gold was also used largely for gilding both metals
and wood. The gold leaf was often about a 5000th
of an inch thick, weighing one grain to the square
inch. Thus a pound’s weight of gold would cover
about six feet square; and the gilding of doors and
of the caps of obelisks as described is not at all unlikely.</p>

<p>Silver was known to the Egyptians later than
gold, as it is called “white gold”; and it was scarcer
than gold in the early ages. Of the prehistoric time
there is a cap of a jar, and a small spoon with twisted
handle. A few silver amulets are known in the
XIIth dynasty. In the XVIIIth dynasty silver
became commoner, as the source in northern Syria
which supplied the Hittites became accessible. The
silver dishes of this age are rather thick, and not
finely beaten. One bowl, probably of Ramesside
date from Bubastis, has the brim turned inward like
a modern anti-splash basin (<a href="#fig113">fig. 115</a>). It seems to
have been made by spinning the metal, as thin vessels
are now wrought.</p>

<p class="caption">108. Silver bowls</p>

<p class="caption">109. Roman gold chain</p>

</div>

<p>The most elaborate style of silver work is that of
the bowls from Mendes (<a href="#fig108">fig. 108</a>). These are entirely
made by hammer work, and no moulds or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
matrices were used for the forms. But the finish
of the surfaces is so fine that no trace of hammer
or polishing is left. The design is derived from the
fluted vases and bowls of the XVIIIth dynasty; the
fluting was made deeper and stronger, and it was
suppressed below, as it interfered with the using of
the bowl, while round the sides it remained as deep
bosses. The detail was all put in by the graving
tool, the sinking round the central rosette, the hollows
in the petals, and the outlines of the petals.
There is no sign of punch-work. The number of
ribs is, curiously, indivisible, being 18, 26, 28, and 30;
these show that it was not divided either by triangles,
hexagons, or repeated halving. Probably a
suitable size of rib was designed, and then repeated
an even number of times; and the divisions not being
truly radial, show that eye-design was followed
rather than geometrical scaling.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">METAL WORK</span></h2>

<p>Here we shall deal with the useful metals, apart
from the ornamental work of jewellery previously
described. Copper was worked from the beginning
of the prehistoric civilisation. In one of the earliest
graves a little copper pin was found, used to fasten
over the shoulders the goat-skin, which was worn
before the weaving of linen. Not long after, a small
chisel appears, then an adze and harpoon, then
needles, and larger sizes of tools come at the close
of the prehistoric age. All of this copper was shaped
by hammering. Polished stone hammers were used,
and the work was so exquisitely regular that a polished
surface still remains on an adze, which shows
no trace of the method of manufacture; certainly it
was not ground. The mode of hammering is shown
in some early historical sculptures; a stone hammer
was held in the palm of the right hand, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
swung overhead, and brought down on the metal.
How such work could be done without hurting the
hand by concussion is not clear to us. It is strange
that down to Greek times the Egyptians never used
a long handle to a hammer.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="100" height="133" alt="Ewer (drawing)" />
</div>

<p>In the beginning of the kingdom, copper ewers
and basins were made; these are known from the
sculpture of Narmer, and examples are found
in the royal tombs. They were skilfully hammered
out, with cast spouts inserted. The
main example of early copper-work is the life-size
statue of King Pepy, and the smaller figure of his
son (<a href="#fig110">fig. 110</a>). The trunk and limbs are of hammered
copper, riveted together; the face, hands,
and feet are cast doubtless by <i>cire perdue</i>. The
ease and truth of the whole figure shows that there
must have been long practice in the artistic working
of copper; yet no traces of such figures are found
earlier, nor for over a thousand years later, and
we may thus realise how scattered are the points
we have, in the view of the art as a whole.</p>

<p>The IXth dynasty has left a coarse example of
cast copper tooled with a graver, the brazier of
Khety, now in Paris. Of the XIIth dynasty there
is not much copper work, except for tools. The
moulds for casting tools were found at Kahun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
They were open moulds, cut out of a thick piece of
pottery, and lined smooth with fine clay and ash.</p>

<p>Down to this age copper was used with only small
amounts of hardening mixture; after this, bronze of
copper and tin came into general use. The earlier
copper of the Ist dynasty usually contains one per
cent. of bismuth, and later than that one or two per
cent. of arsenic, and is “underpoled,” in modern
terms, that is, a good deal of unreduced oxide of
copper is left in the metal. Both of these mixtures
harden it; and by strong hammering it is made still
harder. Copper so treated at present can be made
as hard as mild steel. Thus the metal was fit for the
wood-cutting tools, and for the chisels used for cutting
limestone. The harder stones were worked
with emery.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The earlier source of copper was Sinai, where there yet remain
thousands of tons of copper slag in the Wady Nasb. In the XVIIIth
dynasty and onwards, Cyprus&mdash;the Kupros island of copper&mdash;came
into regular connection with Egypt, and probably supplied most of
the metal.</p>

<p>Bronze has been found in one case as far back as
the IIIrd dynasty, but this was only a chance alloy.
It began to be regularly used in the XVIIIth dynasty,
1600 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>; and the source of the tin for it is
a point of interest in early trade. Cornwall and the
Malay States are the only modern sources of
importance; but probably other surface sources have
been exhausted, as in the case of gold deposits.
Now bronze is found in Central Europe about as
early as in Egypt, and it is unlikely to have been
imported there from Egypt, or to have been traded
there as soon as it would be to a great state like
Egypt. The presumption would be that it originated
about Central Europe. As a district in Saxony
is known as Zinnwald, and crystallised oxide of tin
is still brought from there and from Bohemia, it is
very likely that there may have been stream tin deposits
capable of supplying Europe and Egypt.</p>

<p>In the XVIIIth dynasty bronze vessels were
wrought very skilfully by hammer-work. The flask
(<a href="#fig113">fig. 113</a>) for washing the sandals of Amen, inscribed
with the owner’s name and titles, is 9 inches high
and has a body 4 inches across; it has been hammered
on anvils introduced through the neck, which
is only 1¼ inches wide. By the weight of it (7 ounces)
it cannot average more than ⅟₄₀th inch in thickness.
A general mode of stiffening the thin metal vases
was by fluting the surface (<a href="#fig113">fig. 114</a>), a method also
used in prehistoric Greece.</p>

<p>The casting of bronze was generally done by
the <i>cire perdue</i> method. A core of blackened sand
is usually found in the casting. This was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sand mixed with a little organic matter; as it is
never reddened, probably no clay or mud was used.
Over the core the wax was modelled, and the traces
of the modelling tool can be seen clearly on unfinished
bronzes. On an ibis there was a rolled
pellet of wax put between the beak and the breast,
so as to induce the flow of the metal along the
beak; this would be easily cut away in finishing.
An example of a kneeling figure shows the legs
completely modelled before putting the pleated dress
over them, and then the whole was cast. How the
core was fixed within the outer mould is a difficult
question. On the many unfinished bronzes that I
have examined I have never found a definite connection
above the base, but only casual blowholes. Yet
the metal was often run as thin as ⅟₅₀th so that
a shift of the core by as little as ⅟₁₀₀th inch would
throw the casting out, and make a flaw. How
the core was retained so firmly in position against
the flotation of the melted metal is not clear. No
metal bars were put through the core to steady it,
as Cellini did in his large castings. A system was
used of stiffening bronze-work by casting it over
iron rods; by the free use of iron, this must be of
the Greek period. Solid bronze castings come into
use in Ptolemaic and Roman work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>A favourite decoration of copper-work in later
times, from about 700 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, was by inlaying lines
of gold or silver in it. This is a common system
in India now, where it is known as <i>Keft</i> work; the
name suggests that it was introduced from Egypt,
where Keft was the starting-point of the Indian
trade route from the Nile. One of the finest examples
of this is the statue in the Athens Museum
(figs. <a href="#fig110">111</a>, <a href="#fig110">112</a>); another is the hawk-head and collar
with the name of Aahmes II in the British Museum.
The lines were first chiselled or punched
in the copper, and then the gold was beaten into the
grooves.</p>

<p>No instance of using soft solder to copper or
bronze is known till Roman times.</p>

<p>Lead is found in the prehistoric times in the
form of small figures and little objects; it was probably
brought from Syria. It next appears as a
rather common metal in the XVIIIth dynasty, when
net-sinkers were generally made by bending a piece
of sheet lead round the edge lines of the net, much
as at the present day. In the filling of bronze weights
it is found both in the XVIIIth and XXVIth dynasties.
And an alloy of copper and lead&mdash;now
known as pot-metal&mdash;was commonly used for statuettes
in Greek and Roman times. In Coptic times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pewter bowls and ladles were made; the bowls are
apparently formed by spinning.</p>

<p>Tin is first known in a piece of bronze rod from
Medum, of the IIIrd dynasty. But this was only
a freak, and bronze did not come into use till about
1600 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, probably introduced from Hungary, as
we have noticed. At about 1400 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> there is a
finger-ring of pure tin, known by its crackling when
bent. The metal is, however, scarcely known separate
otherwise.</p>

<p>Antimony occurs in the form of beads about 800
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>; as it was familiar to the Assyrians also, it may
have been traded from them.</p>

<p>Iron working is an important subject in the history
of culture, and the appearances of this metal
in Egypt are curiously sporadic. The notion, often
suggested, that it might rust away and disappear,
is absurd; nothing is more permanent and noticeable
than iron rust. The early examples are: (1)
a piece of sheet iron said to be found between the
stones of Khufu’s pyramid; (2) a lump of iron found
wrapped up with copper axes of the VIth dynasty
form, and placed at the corresponding level in the
foundations of the Abydos temples; this is absolutely
certain and not open to any doubt; (3) iron
ferules said to be found in the masonry of a pyramid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
at Dahshur; (4) an iron falchion said to be found
beneath the base of a statue of Ramessu II. The
certainty about the second example&mdash;which was
found by trained workmen, levelled at the time,
and is stuck together with tools of known date&mdash;prevents
our needing to hesitate about accepting
the less precise authentication of the other examples.</p>

<p>Yet iron continued so scarce until about 800 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
that we find then a thin iron knife with a handle
of bronze cast on it as being the cheaper metal.
The explanation of this intermittent use of iron lies
in an observation of Professor Ridgeway’s, that all
the sites of native iron in the world are where carboniferous
strata and ironstone have been heated
by eruptions of basalt, and thus produced iron by
natural reduction of the ore. Exactly this combination
is found in Sinai. Carboniferous sandstone has
beds of pure black haematite with it, and a thick
flow of basalt has extended over the country. Probably,
therefore, occasional pockets of native iron
were found there by the Egyptians at long intervals,
and thus the use of it was intermittent.</p>

<p>The artificial production of iron seems to have
been known earliest in Assyria; it probably arose
among the Chalybes at the head of the Euphrates,
from whom the Greek name of the metal was derived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Large quantities of iron and steel tools have
been found in the Assyrian ruins, but were neglected
by excavators. A set of armourer’s tools was found
at Thebes with a copper helmet of Assyrian form,
and therefore probably left by the expedition under
Asshur-bani-pal in 666 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> These tools comprise
flat chisels, mortise chisels, saws, a punch, a rasp, a
file, a twist scoop, and two centre-bits. The forms
of most of these tools have already attained to the
modern types; but the file is only slight and irregular,
and the centre-bits are only fit for hard wood.
The edges of these tools are of steel, probably produced
by case-hardening the iron.</p>

<p>We next find iron tools brought in by the Greeks
at Naukratis. Chisels, flat and mortise, with both
tang and socket handles, borers and axe-heads,
were all familiar to the Greek before the Egyptian
adopted them. One instance of an iron adze of
Egyptian type is known, but otherwise it is not
till Coptic times that we find a free use of iron for
knives, chisels, flesh-hooks, hoes, pruning hooks,
and other tools, probably due to Roman influence.
To go further in this subject would lead into the
general history of tools, which is beyond our scope
here.</p>

<span class="smaller">GLAZED WARE</span></h2>

<p>The use of glazing begins far back in the prehistoric
age, some thousands of years before any examples
of glass are known. Glaze is found on a quartz base
as early as on a pottery base; and it seems probable
that it was invented from finding quartz pebbles
fluxed by wood ashes in a hot fire. Hence glazing
on quartz was the starting-point, and glazing on
artificial wares was a later stage. Amulets of quartz
rock are found covered with a coat of blue-green
glaze; a model boat was made of quartz rock in
sections, glazed over, and united by gold bands;
and a large sphinx of quartz, about eighteen inches
long, has evidently been glazed. The fusion of
glaze on the stone partly dissolves the surface; and
even after the glaze has been lost its effect can be
seen by the surface having the appearance of water-worn
marble or sugar candy. This system of glazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
on quartz was continued in historic times; clear
crystal beads flashed over with a rich blue glaze
are found in the XIIth dynasty; and large blocks
were glazed in the XVIIIth dynasty.</p>

<p>The use of a pottery ware for covering with glaze
begins with beads of blue and green in the prehistoric
necklaces. The pottery base for glazing is
never a clay in Egypt, but always a porous body
of finely-ground silica, either sand or quartz rock.
This was slightly bound together, but the whole
strength of the object was in the soaking of glaze
on the outer surface.</p>

<p class="caption">118. Head of Isis</p>

<p class="caption">119. Royal fan-bearer</p>

</div>

<p>An astonishing development of glazed ware came
at the beginning of the monarchy. A piece of a
vase (<a href="#fig116">fig. 116</a>) with the name of Mena, the first
king of Egypt, is of green glazed pottery, and it is
surprising to find the royal name inlaid in a second
coloured glaze, which has probably been violet,
though now decomposed. Thus two-colour glazing
in designs was used as early as 5500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> And at
this date glazing was not only a fine art, it was
used on a large scale for the lining of rooms. Tiles
have been found about a foot long, stoutly made,
with dovetails on the back, and holes through them
edgeways in order to tie them back to the wall with
copper wire. They are glazed all over with hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
blue-green glaze. The front is ribbed in imitation
of reedwork, and they probably were copied from
reed mats used to line the walls. Part of a tile has
large hieroglyphs inlaid in colour, showing that decorative
inscriptions were set up. Rather later, at
the beginning of the IIIrd dynasty, there is the
doorway of glazed tiles of King Zeser, with his
name and titles in various colours; this doorway,
now in Berlin, belonged to a room in the Step pyramid
entirely lined with glazed tile.</p>

<p>Smaller objects were also made in glaze. A
tablet of the first dynasty bears a relief of the figure
and titles of an aboriginal chief, apparently made
to be left as a memorial of his visit to temples&mdash;a
sort of visiting card,&mdash;as it was found in the temple
of Abydos. Figures of women and animals were
found with it, and glazed toggles to be used in
place of buttons on garments. Very little glazing
has been preserved to us from the pyramid age;
there are small tablets with the name of King Pepy
(4100 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) in relief, but roughly done.</p>

<p>The general colour of the early glaze is greenish-blue
or blue-green, never distinctly of either colour.
Such appears from the prehistoric age to the pyramid
time. The glaze is full, and was not heated
long enough to soak into the body. It often has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pit-holes in it, and does not seem to have been
very fluid. In the VIth dynasty a second colour
appears, a dark indigo blue; this is on a scarab of
Merenra, and on small toilet vases of the period.
Some earlier scarabs are probably of the age of
the IVth, and even of the IIIrd dynasty; these
have a clear brilliant blue glaze, thin and well
fused.</p>

<p>In the XIIth dynasty the glaze is thin and hard.
On ring-stands and vases it is often dry and of a
greyish green. A rich clear blue glaze was also
used, and is best seen on scarabs and on the favourite
figures of hippopotami, which were only made
in this period. The designs and inscriptions in the
glaze were of a fine black, apparently coloured with
manganese.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth dynasty was the great age of the
development of glazing. It began with so close a
continuance of the style of the XIIth dynasty that
it is hard to discriminate one from the other. Down
to the time of Tahutmes III the small pieces and
beads with blue colour are as those of the previous
age; but the large bowls are of a brighter blue and
rather a wetter glaze. At the beginning of the
dynasty there is also a dark green glaze used upon
schist, mostly seen on the elaborately carved kohl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
pots. Under Amenhotep II was made the largest
piece of glazing that is known from Egypt, now in
South Kensington Museum. This was a great <i>uas</i>
sceptre made as an offering, the stem of which is
five feet long. This length was built up of separate
sections of body ware, made each about nine inches
long, so as to have sufficient firmness; after they
were each baked they were then united with a slip
paste of the same ware, and finally fired with a
single flow of glaze over the whole five-feet length.
The head was made separately. The special difficulty
of firing such large pieces is to maintain a
uniform heat over the whole, and to avoid any
reducing flame from the fuel, which would discolour
the glaze, and produce lustre ware. The heating
must also be brief, so as to avoid the glaze running
down, or soaking into the porous body and leaving
it dry.</p>

<p>Under Amenhotep III and IV the art of glazing
reached its most brilliant development, both in
its colours and in the variety of its applications.
Beside the previously used shades of blue and
green we meet with purple-blue, violet, a brilliant
apple-green, bright chrome-yellow, lemon-yellow,
crimson-red, brown-red, and milk-white. Besides
the previous uses of glaze for bowls and vases, beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and scarabs, we now meet with a great variety of
pendants and ornaments for necklaces, more than
two hundred and fifty forms of which are known
from the objects and the moulds; also flat emblems
and name plaques, with stitch holes or loops at the
edge, for stitching on to the muslin dresses then
worn. The private person thus wore the king’s
name on his arm, and the king wore the titles of
the sun-god to whom he was devoted. The effect of
the white muslin dresses with dazzling blue plaques
and natural coloured daisies and other flowers scattered
over them, must have been very striking.
Another use of glaze was for architectural inlaying
(<a href="#fig116">fig. 117</a>). The capitals of great columns were inlaid
all over with stripes of red and blue along the
palm leaf design, separated into small squares by
gilt bands between. The whole capital was thus
copied on a vast scale from cloison jewellery. Another
use of glaze was for inlaying coloured hieroglyphs
in the white limestone walls. This system
was carried on in a simpler way into the next
dynasty, where a great quantity of cartouches of
Sety II are known; and in the walls of the temple
of Luqsor are rows of holes of corresponding size,
from which they have probably been taken. A
favourite form of glazed ware in the XVIIIth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
XIXth dynasties is that of the graceful lotus flower
cup.</p>

<p>In the XIXth dynasty there is much less variety
of glazing; but we meet with the rise of a new industry
which was to eclipse all the others in its output.
Sety I had many glazed figures of <i>ushabtis</i> of
blue colour inscribed in black, or of glazed steatite,
in his tomb. Under Ramessu II they became usual
for private persons, and for a thousand years later
they were made in enormous numbers, usually four
hundred being buried in any wealthy tomb. The
Ramesside <i>ushabtis</i> are usually green with black inscriptions,
rarely white with purple. In the XXIst
dynasty they are of very intense blue with purple-black
inscriptions, and very roughly made, deteriorating
throughout the dynasty. In the XXIInd and
XXIIIrd dynasties they are small, and usually
green and black. In the XXVth they are mere red
pottery dipped in blue wash, or little slips of mud
were substituted. The XXVIth dynasty started
a different class of very large figures, up to ten
inches high, beautifully modelled, with incised inscriptions,
back pillar, and beard, always of green
glaze; and these deteriorated to Ptolemaic times,
excepting that there are some splendid blue ones
of Nectanebo, and smaller ones of bright colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with ink inscriptions of private persons of his
time.</p>

<p>About the XXVIth dynasty, glazed figures of the
gods were made for popular use, and by about 300
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> they appear in vast numbers, very roughly
moulded. Some of the earlier pieces are very beautifully
modelled, and glazed so exactly that the hollows
are not at all filled up. A head of Isis (<a href="#fig116">fig. 118</a>),
and a half-length figure of a fan-bearer (<a href="#fig116">fig. 119</a>)
are perhaps the finest pieces of such work. The
latter figure is remarkable for the vigour of the
muscles and the overbearing official dignity of the
expression.</p>

<p>Great numbers of amulets were also made to be
buried with the mummies or worn by the living.
The earlier examples are fairly modelled, of apple-green
tint; in Persian times they are sharp and dry
in form and of an olive-grey colour, but they became
very roughly and coarsely moulded in Ptolemaic
times. There are some interesting modelled
heads of this age, covered with blue or green glaze,
such as a Ptolemaic queen, and a woman wearing a
face veil. Vases of Greek and Roman styles were
also common. A delicate thin ware with Assyrianesque
figures, in white on a slightly sunk blue
ground, was made in the Persian time and continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
into the Ptolemaic age. Large blocks for legs of
furniture, and stands, were also made now. The
characteristic colours are of a dark Prussian blue
bordering on violet, and an apple-green.</p>

<p>In the Roman age there is an entirely new style.
The body of the vase is of a purple-black colour,
with a wreath of bright green leaves around it.
Such continued almost to Coptic times. The bulk
of the Roman glaze is of coarse forms, and bright
Prussian blue in tint. The vases have animals in
relief, apparently under Persian influence. The flat
trays with straight sides are copies of the silver
dishes of the time. The old style of glazing continued
down to Arab times; a steatite amulet, in
the cutting, and colour of the glaze, might well have
been of the Shishak age, but for the Arabic inscription
upon it. And at the present day some creditable
imitations of ancient glazing are made for
fraudulent trade at Thebes.</p>

<p>Turning to the more technical matters, the body
of the ware is always a porous, friable, siliceous
paste; in some cases so soft that it can be rubbed
away from the broken surfaces by the finger. The
unglazed beads and figures occasionally found can
hardly be handled without breaking. This paste
was moulded roughly into form, and when dry it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was graved with a point to give the detail. If it
broke in the fingers a good figure would be stuck
together again with a scrap of the paste before glazing.
Large objects were made in sections, dried and
baked, and then joined up with some of the same
paste, and re-baked before covering with glaze. In
the XXVIth dynasty there is a beautiful hard stoneware,
apparently made by mixing some glaze with
the body, enough to fuse it together into a solid mass
throughout. The surface of these works is always
very fine and smooth, without any face glaze, but
only the compact polished body. The usual colour
is apple-green, but violet is sometimes found in the
early examples of the XVIIIth dynasty.</p>

<p>The colours were rarely anything beyond shades
of green and blue. These were produced by compounds
of copper; the blue is especially free from
iron, which even in traces produces a green tint.
The blue if exposed to damp fades white; the
green changes to brown, owing to the decomposition
of green silicate of iron and the production of
brown oxide of iron. This decomposition may go
on beneath an unbroken polished face of glaze,
changing the glaze to brown. The shades of blue
and green were all experimentally produced in modern
times by Dr Russell, F.R.S., who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in exactly copying the purple blue, full blue, light
blue and French blue, and the green-blues and full
greens in more than a hundred tints. The method
was indicated by the half-baked pans of colour
found at Tell-el-Amarna. Quartz rock pebbles had
been collected, and served for the floor of the glazing
furnaces. After many heatings which cracked
them they were pounded into fine chips. These
were mixed with lime and potash and some carbonate
of copper. The mixture was roasted in pans,
and the exact shade depended on the degree of
roasting. The mass was half fused and became
pasty; it was then kneaded and toasted gradually,
sampling the colour until the exact tint was reached.
A porous mass of frit of uniform colour results.
This was then ground up in water, and made
into a blue or green paint, which was either used
with a flux to glaze objects in a furnace, or was
used with gum or white of egg as a wet paint for
frescoes.</p>

<p>The ovens were small, about two or three feet
across; cylindrical pots were set upside down and
a fire lighted between them, and the pans of colour
rested on the bottom edges of the pots. In Roman
times the glazing furnaces were about eight feet
square and deep, with an open arch to windward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
half way up. The vases and dishes were stacked
in the furnace upon cylinder pots, and the successive
dishes in the piles were kept apart by cones
of pottery nearly an inch high. The failure of a
furnace-load has revealed the system; by too long
heating the glaze soaked through the porous body,
and it all settled down and partly fell to pieces.</p>

<p>The other colours used were: for the red a body
mixed with haematite and covered with a transparent
glaze; bright yellow, the composition of
which is unknown; violet in various depths, from
a faint tinge on the white lotus petals to a deep
strong colour, probably made by copper blue and
one of the purples; purple in various strengths from
a rich bright tint upon white to a black purple for
designs upon blue, all produced by manganese;
occasionally purple-blue made with cobalt; dead
white, which was doubtless produced by tin as at
present.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of glazing we may
notice the system of moulding pendants and figures
in red pottery moulds, of all sizes from a quarter
of an inch to three or four inches across. A great
variety of these is found at Tell-el-Amarna of the
XVIIIth dynasty, and at Memphis of later periods.
They sometimes contain the remains of the siliceous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
paste with which they were choked when they were
thrown away. At Naukratis hundreds were found
for making scarabs for the Greek trade. The moulded
objects were covered with glazing wash, and
put into the furnace. Beads were commonly made
on a thread, dried, and the thread burnt out; they
were then dipped in glaze-wash, and fired. In early
times small beads were rolled between the thumb
and finger on the thread, producing a long tapering
form like a grain of corn.</p>

<h3>GLASS</h3>

<p>There has been much misunderstanding about
the age of glass in Egypt. Figures of smiths blowing
a fire with reeds tipped with clay have been
quoted as figures blowing glass, though no blown
glass is known in Egypt before Roman times. A
cylinder of glass of King Pepy has been quoted;
but this is really of clear iceland-spar or selenite
lined with coloured paste. A panther’s head with
the name of Antef V has been called glass, but it
is really of blue paste. Various pieces of inlaid
stone jewellery have been mistaken for glass, but
none such is known till late times.</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any working
of glassy material by itself, apart from a base of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stone or pottery, until after 1600 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> The earliest
dated pieces are an eye of blue glass imitating turquoise,
with the name of Amenhotep I (1550 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>),
and a piece of a glass vase with an inlaid name of
Tahutmes III. Beads of this age are plain black
with a white spot on opposite sides; black and white
glass cups probably belong to the same date. The
variety of colours quickly increased, and by the time
of Amenhotep III and IV, about 1400 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, there
were violet, deep Prussian blue, light blue, green,
yellow, orange, red (rare), clear white, milky white,
and black.</p>

</div>

<p>The designs were entirely ruled by the method
of manufacture. The glass was never cast, but was
worked as a pasty mass, and all the decoration was
made by inlaying threads of glass drawn out to
various thicknesses. The actual production of the
glass we deal with below. The patterns on a vase
or bead were produced by winding threads around
the body, and then dragging the surface at regular
intervals (figs. <a href="#fig120">120</a>, <a href="#fig120">121</a>). If dragged always in one
direction, it made a series of loops or U pattern; if
dragged alternately each way it made an ogee pattern.
Around the neck and foot a thick thread was
often put on, with a thin thread spirally round it,
usually white with black spiral. The forms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
vases are those usual in other materials at this period,
such as <a href="images/i_121a.jpg"><img class="inline" src="images/i_121a.jpg" alt="three different shapes of vase (drawing)" /></a>. This same method was followed
in the glass found at Cumae near
Naples, dating from about 700 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> It is distinguished
from the Egyptian fabric by a duller surface
and duller colouring, and a common form unknown
before is <a href="images/i_121b.jpg"><img class="inline" src="images/i_121b.jpg" alt="this shape of vase (drawing)" /></a>. This later glass is usually
mixed with the earlier in museums, and occasionally
it is difficult to distinguish it; but both the
forms and the colour leave very little doubt as to
the age.</p>

<p>This system of winding threads of glass was
usual for beads also. A mere chip of a glass bead
can be distinguished, whether Egyptian or Roman,
by the direction of the streaks and bubbles in it.
The early glass is all wound, with lines running
around; the Roman glass is all drawn out and
nicked off, with lines running along; the medieval
and modern Venetian beads are again wound, and
some of the recent ones closely imitate Egyptian
dragged patterns, but can be distinguished by the
opacity of most of the colours.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth dynasty workers also cut and engraved
glass, though but rarely. They sometimes
produced a clear glass entirely free of colouring, even
in a thickness of half an inch. About the XXIIIrd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
dynasty (750 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) a clear, greenish Prussian blue
glass was usual for beads, and continued to Persian
times for scarabs (500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Rather later, about
400-200 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, there appears a large development of
opaque glass figures of hieroglyphs, cut and polished,
to inlay in wooden caskets and coffins. Opaque
red and blue to imitate jasper and lazuli were the
most usual colours. Figures of the four genii of the
dead and other usual amulets were commonly made
by pressing the glass into moulds while heated. A
favourite colouring for such was a deep, clear, true
blue, backed with opaque white to show up the colour.</p>

<p>About the later Ptolemaic time and through the
Roman age the main work in glass is that of minute
mosaics (<a href="#fig120">fig. 122</a>). They were built up with
glass rods, heated until they half fused together,
and then drawn out so as to produce a great length
of much reduced section. Thus patterns of extreme
delicacy were produced; and one single piece of
construction could be cut across into a hundred
slices, each repeating the whole design. The patterns
are sometimes purely Egyptian, as <i>ankh</i> and
<i>uas</i> alternately, but more usually Roman, such as
heads and flower patterns. Such mosaics were
mounted in jewellery, or, on a coarser scale, set in
large designs for caskets and temple furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristic of Roman times is the use of
blown glass. The cups, bottles, and vases were
nearly all blown, often with threads woven around,
dabs attached and impressed, or patterns stamped
while soft. The feet of cups were modelled into
form while pasty, the tool marks showing plainly
upon them. Ornamental stamps were pressed on
soft lumps put on the sides of vases. Such stamps
became used for official marks, and in early Arab
times they registered the substance for which the
glass measure was intended, also the amount of
the capacity, and the maker’s name in many cases.
Another main development of Byzantine and Arab
glass was for weights, usually to test gold and silver
coins, but also for larger amounts up to a pound.
These weights bear the stamps of the Byzantine
epochs in a few cases, but are found by the hundred
of the VIIIth to Xth centuries, and by the thousand
of the Xth to XIth centuries, dying out at the early
crusading age.</p>

<p>We now turn to the purely technical side, to describe
the process of manufacture in the time of
Amenhotep IV, about 1370 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when it is best
known to us, from the remains of the factory at Tell-el-Amarna.
A clear glass could be produced, which
was usually not quite colourless, but sufficiently so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to take up various colours. It was free of lead and
borates, and consisted of pure silica from crushed
quartz pebbles, and alkali doubtless from wood
ashes. It was fused in pans of earthenware. This
glass was coloured by dissolving the blue or green
frit in it, or mixing other opaque colours. Samples
were taken out by pincers to test the colour at different
stages. The whole mass was fairly fused, and
then left to get cold in the earthen pan, which was
about four or five inches across, and held half an inch
to an inch deep of the glass. When cold the pan
was chipped away, the frothy top of the glass was
chipped off, and lumps of pure glass were obtained
free from sediment and scum. A lump of glass thus
purified was heated to a pasty state, and patted into
a cylindrical form, then rolled under a bar of metal,
which was run diagonally across it, until it was reduced
to a rod about the size of a lead pencil, or
rather less. Such a rod was then heated, and drawn
out into “cane” about ⅛ inch thick. Every vase
was built up from such cane.</p>

<p>For making a vase a copper mandril was taken,
slightly tapering, of the size of the interior of the
neck. Upon the end of this was built a body of
soft siliceous paste, tied up in rag, and baked upon
it, of the size of the interior of the intended vase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The marks of the string and cloth can still be seen
inside the vases. On this body of powdery material
glass cane was wound hot until it was uniformly
coated. It was re-heated by sticking the end of
the mandril into the oven as often as needful; glass
threads of various colours were wound round it;
and the whole was rolled to and fro so as to bed in
the threads and make a smooth surface. A brim, a
foot, and handles were attached. Finally, on cooling,
the copper mandril contracted, and could be taken
out of the neck, the soft paste could be rubbed out
of the interior, and the vase was finished. The
final face is always a fused surface, and was never
ground or polished.</p>

<p>A similar mode was followed for the glass beads.
The thread of glass was wound upon a hot copper
wire of the size of the hole required; and after piling
on enough, and completing the pattern of colour
the wire contracted in cooling and could be withdrawn.
The little point where the thread of glass
broke off can be seen at each end of the beads.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE POTTERY</span></h2>

<p>The varieties of pottery are so extensive that from
the prehistoric age alone a thousand are figured, and
the later ages give at least thrice that number. We
cannot attempt to give even an outline of a subject
which alone would far outrun this volume. A single
most typical form of each main period is here shown,
to illustrate the entirely different ideas which prevailed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig">

<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="400" height="370" alt="Typical forms of each period (drawing): Pre. I V XII XVIII XIX XXVI Ro." />

</div>

<p><i>Forms.</i>&mdash;In the prehistoric age many of the forms
have no marked brim. The bowls, conical cups, and
jars simply end at a plain edge, like this marked Pre.
Brims were more usual in the later prehistoric age.
A great variety of fancy forms appeared&mdash;double
vases, square bottles, fish, birds, or women were
modelled; and as the whole pottery was handmade,
such were no more difficult to make than circular
forms. On coming to the Ist dynasty the forms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
more clumsy, such as that marked I; and some of
the earlier forms were continued in a very degraded
state. The main feature is the class of very large
jars, two to three feet high, which were used for storing
food and drink. This class rapidly deteriorated
and became almost extinct by the IIIrd dynasty.
In the pyramid age some neatly-made pottery is
found; thin sharp-brimmed bowls were usual, and
the form marked V, with a sharply pointed base,
was peculiar to this time. By the XIIth dynasty the
globular or drop-shaped pot was the prevalent type,
and varies in size from a couple of inches to a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of feet. Drinking-cups of a hemispherical form,
very thin, without any brim, are also of this age.
The XVIIIth dynasty was begun with long graceful
forms, such as XVIII; and later some beautiful
long-necked vases are found. All of these forms
rapidly degraded in the XIXth dynasty, and ugly
small handles come into use, probably influenced by
Greek design. In the XXVIth dynasty, lids with
knob handles became common, and accordingly the
brim disappeared, and a plain edge was used which
could be easily capped. The large jars of this age
are of Greek origin. During the Ptolemaic time
debasement went on; and the most ugly, smug,
commonplace forms belong to the Roman age.
They are mostly ribbed, as in this marked Ro. The
big amphorae begin with ribbing in the latter part
of the second century, in broad fluting curves. These
became narrower and sharper, until in the sixth and
seventh centuries the ribbing had become almost
a mere combed pattern around the jar. The jars
also decreased in size, were thicker, softer, and
coarser, until the type vanished with the Arab
times.</p>

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;The earliest painting on prehistoric
vases was of white slip, in line patterns, copied from
basket-work, and rarely in figures, such as <a href="#fig65">fig. 65</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
This white paint was put over a bright red facing
of haematite; and such red and white pottery is still
made with closely similar patterns by the mountain
tribes of Algeria, where the style seems never to
have died out. The black tops of the early red vases
we shall deal with under Materials. The later prehistoric
painting was in dull red on a buff body, such
as <a href="#fig65">fig. 66</a>. In the pyramid age there was only a
polished red haematite facing, and in the XIIth
dynasty even this was not used. About the XVIIth
dynasty a fine red polish was common, which ceased
early in the XVIIIth dynasty; white on the brims,
or dabbed in finger-spots over the inside of saucers,
was also of the XVIIth dynasty. Black or red edges
to pottery next appeared, and by Tahutmes III
there was a style of narrow black and red stripes alternating.
The use of blue paint, of copper frit,
began under Amenhotep II, but it was not usual
until Amenhotep III, and it was common until the
close of the XIXth dynasty, though much flatter
and poorer than at first. After this there was no
decoration on pottery until the late Roman time.
About the age of Constantine a hard, fine pottery
came into use, with a thin red wash on it, and often
of a pale salmon colour throughout. When the
southern tribes pushed down into Egypt, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
brown and red patterns which were usual in Nubia
were carried with the invaders, and such painting
was the main influence in the painted Coptic
pottery.</p>

<p><i>Materials.</i>&mdash;The prehistoric pottery of the earlier
period is all of a soft body, faced with red haematite.
As the pots were usually baked mouth downward,
the brim was covered with the ashes; and these not
being burnt through, reduced the red peroxide of
iron to the black magnetic sesqui-oxide, such as is
familiar to us in the black scale on sheet steel. The
interior of the pots is likewise black, owing to the reducing
gases from the ashes below; rarely the heat
after the combustion has lasted long enough for the
oxygen to pass through the pottery, and so redden
the inside. Open dishes were also haematite-faced
inside, and the iron is reduced to a brilliant mirror-like
coat of black all over. The reason of the polish
being smoother on the black than on the red parts
is that carbonyl gas&mdash;which is the result of imperfect
combustion&mdash;is a solvent of magnetic oxide of
iron, and so dissolves and re-composes the surface
facing. On once understanding the chemistry of
this, it is needless to discuss the old idea that smoke
blackened this pottery. Smoke&mdash;or fine carbon dust&mdash;could
not possibly penetrate through close-grained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
pottery, and the black extends all through the mass,
naturally owing to the action of reducing gases to
which the pottery is quite pervious. There may
perhaps be some other kinds of black pottery influenced
by smoke; but it is far more probable that
all black pottery is due to black oxide of iron produced
by imperfect combustion, which is accompanied
by smoke.</p>

<p>In the later prehistoric age the pottery has a hard
reddish buff body with white specks. In the pyramid
period a smooth soft brown body is usual. Hard
drab pottery also appears in the Vth and VIth dynasties.
In the XIIth dynasty the common soft
brown body is general, and extends to the XVIIIth.
By the middle of the XVIIIth dynasty a hard drab
ware with white specks and faced with a drab polish
is very characteristic, and continues into the XIXth.
Thence onward the brown body reasserts itself, with
some inferior greenish drab ware about the XXIInd
dynasty. Greek clays appear during the XXVIth,
but probably all imported from Greece. Soft red
pottery belongs to the Ptolemaic age. But the old
soft brown rules in the Roman time, being at its
worst in the early Coptic. The thin hard ware of
the Constantine age is apparently not native, and
may be due either to Nubian or Roman influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Modelling.</i>&mdash;A constant use of pottery for modelling
should be mentioned, although we cannot illustrate
such a large subject here, as it is only subsidiary
to stone-work in each age. In the prehistoric time
rude figures are often found, both of men and women.
Little is known of pottery modelling in the Old and
Middle Kingdoms. Rough figures of cows are
placed upon the brims of bowls about the XIth and
XIIth dynasties. In the XVIIIth-XXVth dynasties
a large use of roughly modelled <i>ushabti</i> figures
of servants prevailed. But it is rarely that the other
modelling is apart from foreign influence. A class
of exquisitely formed figure-bottles, of women and
animals, was made of fine foreign clay, probably by
Greeks, at this age. Also rude solid figures of
men and horses extend from this time onwards. The
great age of pottery figures begins with the modelled
heads of foreigners from the foreign quarter of
Memphis, certainly due to Greek admixture. These
are admirably done, and each hand-modelled singly.
They begin about 500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, and by about 300 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
moulded figures come into use. At first these are
solid, but from about 200 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> down to 300 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> they
are moulded hollow, being made of a front and back
half united. The enormous number of these figures,
and of figure-lamps made similarly, is very familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
from the Roman period. It is remarkable what
good work is shown in some figures even as late as
250 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> The late dating of the figures and the
varieties of the lamps are illustrated in <i>Roman
Ehnasya</i> from my own excavations.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">IVORY-WORKING</span></h2>

<p>In prehistoric times ivory was much used, doubtless
owing to the elephant being still abundant in
southern Egypt. The natural form of the tusk was
often left, and the surface worked in low relief;
but the earlier work was on small pieces, as in figs.
<a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig15">15</a>, <a href="#fig15">17</a>. Not only elephant ivory was used, but
also that of the hippopotamus. At the beginning
of the Ist dynasty ivory was largely used for statuettes
and carvings. One of the best examples of
this school is the figure of the aged king (<a href="#fig19">fig. 21</a>).
Many other carvings of girls, boys, apes, lions and
dogs were found with this at Abydos. At Hierakonpolis
a great mass of ivories was found in a
trench six feet long, and many of them have been
preserved. They are figures of men and women,
carved tusks, wands, and cylinders. In the tomb of
Mena’s queen at Naqadeh were ivory lions and
dogs, and such were also found in the tomb of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Zer at Abydos, used for gaming pieces. All of
this early ivory-work is vigorous, and has the character
and spirit of the early art.</p>

<p>The finest work known in ivory is the portrait of
Khufu, the builder of the great pyramid (<a href="#fig123">fig. 123</a>).
It is here much magnified, as the face is only a
quarter of an inch high. Yet in this minute space
one of the most striking portraits has been given.
The far-seeing determination, the energy and will
expressed in this compass, would animate a life-size
figure; indeed, it would be hard in the illustration
to distinguish it from a work on a large scale.
The correct position of the ear should be noted, as
it is always put too high up in later sculpture.
Quite apart from the marvellous minuteness of the
work, we must estimate this as one of the finest
character-sculptures that remain to us.</p>

<p>A piece of open work, of a girl standing, is probably
of the Old Kingdom (<a href="#fig123">fig. 124</a>). It is not of
the style of hair or treatment of the Middle or New
Kingdom; and in the Saitic age, when the older
style was copied, the work is worse in pose and
much more detailed and punctilious. There are
some beautiful pieces of architectural models in
ivory, from the inlaying of a casket, and, also, a
figure of the Vth dynasty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Middle Kingdom an ivory baboon is perhaps
the finest work; it has disappeared from the
museum when at Bulak, and its place is unknown.
A broken figure of a boy carrying a calf shows
great truth and spirit. Ivory was also used for
lion-head draughtsmen in the XVIIIth dynasty,
but there are no fine works of that time.</p>

<p>Of the XXVIth dynasty two fine pieces have
been found at Memphis, a lotus flower (<a href="#fig123">fig. 125</a>) and
a man bearing offerings (<a href="#fig123">fig. 126</a>). These had been
applied to the sides of caskets or other small woodwork.
The figure of the man is but a stiff and
coarse copy of the Old Kingdom work, lacking the
truth and freedom of the early time.</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any distinctive
school of ivory-work in Egypt. The methods
and nature of the objects are just what might have
been done in stone or in wood at the same period.
There is no sign of a special development due
to the material, as there is in the Chinese ivory-carving.</p>

<p>Wood was by no means so rare in early times as
it is now in Egypt. Floyer has shown how much
the desert has been stripped by the introduction of
the tree-feeding camel. We see in the royal tombs
of the Ist dynasty a large use of wood. The
funeral chamber sunk in the ground was entirely
built of massive beams and planks. The area of
this room was 900 square feet in the largest tomb,
varying down to 300 in the lesser. The framing
of the floor, the supports, and the roof beams were
about 10 × 7 inches in section and up to 21 feet in
length. The planking of the floor still remains
2 to 2½ inches thick; and probably that of the roof
was equal to it, as it had to bear about three feet
of sand over it. The great scale of this timber work
agrees with the “royal axe-man” being one of the
high officials; before stone came into use, this title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was the equivalent of chief architect. Such a free
use of wood shows that the elaborate framing of
façades, which is represented as a usual pattern in
early stone-work, was actually copied from wooden
mansions, just as the Greek architecture was an
elaborate copy of woodwork. At the close of the
IIIrd dynasty we have a glimpse of the large use
of wood for shipbuilding, when Senoferu built in
one year sixty ships, and imported forty ships of
cedar. The great gates of the temple enclosures
and palaces must also have been massive works;
the outer and inner pylon at Karnak had gates
fifteen feet wide on either side, and over sixty feet
high.</p>

<p>The wooden coffins of the Old Kingdom are
heavy boxes with sides two to three inches thick.
They are fastened together by bolts of wood; and
such wooden pegs are run diagonally in different
directions so as to prevent the parts being separated.
Coffins hollowed out of a single block, to fit the outline
of the mummy, were also used in all the earlier
periods. In late times such forms were built up of
boards.</p>

<p>For securing the joints of furniture from racking,
two correct systems were used. For chairs, angle-pieces
were cut from wood with bent grain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
fitted on inside the angles. There must have been
a constant demand for such bent pieces, and probably
they were grown into shape. In other cases
forms of wood have been found which had clearly
been grown for many years into the shape required.
The angle-pieces can be seen under the front of
the seat in <a href="#fig127">fig. 128</a>. Another system for stands
was to put in diagonal bars, as in <a href="#fig127">fig. 130</a>. Sometimes
merely the stiffness of deep panelling was
trusted, as in <a href="#fig127">fig. 129</a>. For the backs of chairs an
excellent triangular stay was made, as in <a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a>.</p>

<p>The light and skilful forms of the woodwork are
well shown in the furniture (<a href="#fig127">figs. 127-131</a>) from the
tomb of Yuaa and Thuiu, the parents of Queen
Thyi, in the XVIIIth dynasty. The reliefs on the
chair are carved in wood and gilded. The decoration
on the casket (<a href="#fig127">fig. 129</a>) is of blue glazed hieroglyphs
and inlays.</p>

<p>Wood was also much used for statuettes. The
ebony negress and other figures (<a href="#fig40">figs. 40-42</a>) show it
on a small scale; larger figures were also made, such
as several in the Turin Museum, and some of life-size,
but the latter are coarser in work, as the figure
of Sety I in the British Museum. A fine figure
almost life-size remains from the XIIIth dynasty,
King Hor, in the Cairo Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>A system of inlaying coloured stones, glazes or
glass, in wood as a basis, is found as early as the
Vth dynasty, in the model vases of Nofer-ar-ka-ra.
In the XVIIIth dynasty this method of decoration
is seen on the gigantic mummy-cases of the
Queens Aah-hotep and Aahmes, which were inlaid,
probably with lazuli. The inlay was so valuable
that soon after it was all prised out with the corner
of an adze, and blue paint substituted for it. In the
XXIIIrd dynasty decorative figures were wrought
in wood, with the whole detail in inlay, as in the
group of Pedubast. And in the Greek period large
wooden coffins were encrusted with inlay of coloured
glass, and the sides of wooden shrines were similarly
the basis for brilliant polychrome adornment.</p>

<p>Regarding the methods of woodworking, certainly
the axe was the primitive tool, as shown by
the royal architect being designated by the axe. In
the scenes of the pyramid age we find the saw about
three feet long worked with both hands, the mallet
and chisel for cutting mortise-holes, and the adze
in constant use for shaping and for smoothing wood.
To this day the small adze is a favourite tool of the
Egyptian carpenter and boat-builder. For smoothing
down the caulking inside a boat, heavy pounders
of stone were used, held by a handle worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
out on each side of the block. Drills were also
commonly used both on wood and stone, worked
by a bow. The subject of tools and their variations
is a very wide one, which cannot be entered
upon here.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">PLASTER AND STUCCO</span></h2>

<p>In the masonry of the pyramids, plaster is constantly
used, both to fill joints as a bedding, and to
level up hollows in a face. The plaster used is a
mixture of ordinary lime and plaster of Paris, the
carbonate and sulphate of lime. How it was introduced
into the joints of the pyramid casing is a mystery.
The blocks at the base weigh sixteen tons, so
that no free sliding to reduce the joint-filling could
be done; yet the vertical joint, five feet high and
seven feet long, is filled with a film of plaster only
a fiftieth of an inch thick. The joints of the masonry
in the passages and chambers are all filled
with plaster, though so close as to be almost imperceptible.
In the core masonry a coarse plaster
was poured between the stones and filled into hollows.
The flaws and defects in the faces of stones
were freely filled with plaster, which was coloured
to match the stone. In rock tombs plaster was used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to fill up cracks and hollows; and it often remains
in perfect condition while the rock around has
decayed.</p>

<p>Plaster was also used on the brick walls, which
were faced with a hard coat about a tenth to a sixteenth
of an inch thick, upon which paintings were
executed. By the XVIIIth dynasty this became
a mere whitewash over the mud-facing of the wall.
In the roughly-hewn rock tombs of that age at
Thebes, the jagged surfaces were smoothed by a
coat of plaster, often two or three inches thick in
the hollows. A strange use of stucco was for a
thin coat over sculpture, as a basis for colouring.
Such a coat was even laid over statuary. In all
ages this hid to some extent the full detail of the
sculptor’s work in reliefs. In the XIIth dynasty the
finest lines were hidden by it; and on coming down
to the Ptolemaic times the plasterer ignored all the
sculpture below, filling the figures with a smooth
daub of plaster on which the painter drew what he
liked. It seems strange why the sculptors should
have continued to put fine work and detail on to a
surface where they were going to be at once ignored.
It suggests a rigid bureaucracy in which the sculpture
had to be passed by one man, and the painting
by another, without any collaboration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Stucco was used for independent modelling, as
in Italy. It was laid on a flat canvas base, stretched
over wood, and the whole relief was in the stucco.
The chariot of Tahutmes IV is one of the main
examples of such work, of which a small portion
is shown in <a href="#fig132">fig. 132</a>. The relief is low and smooth,
and full of detail; there is none of the sketchy
rough tooling, as seen in Roman stucco reliefs.
Minute details of dress and hair are all tooled in,
and supply some of the best studies of Syrian robes.
The varying patterns on the shields of different
branches of Syrians, the feathering of the arrows,
the shape of the daggers, and the flowers of the
papyrus and lotus of north and south, are all most
precisely rendered. It would be hard to find any
point in which more details could be introduced.</p>

<p class="caption">133, 134. Plaster castings for studies</p>

</div>

<p>Plaster was also used for casting in moulds, and
for making moulds. The death mask of Akhenaten
shows how such castings were produced in the
XVIIIth dynasty, from a single mould without any
undercutting, to serve the purpose of the sculptor
as a model. Of later examples of such castings we
have here a lion’s head and a king’s head (figs. <a href="#fig132">133</a>,
<a href="#fig132">134</a>). They were probably made to be supplied as
school copies to the workshops where the sculptors
were trained. Plaster moulds are very common at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Memphis, and it is said they were even used for
casting bronze work. This is very doubtful, as
plaster is reduced to powder at 260° C., while moulds
for bronze casting must be heated to 1500° to 1800°
C.; they are more probably for casting pewter.
Plaster moulds were also used for moulding pottery
lamps. The oiling of plaster was done on painted
plaster statuettes, so as to make them waterproof.
They can still be scrubbed in water without disturbing
the colour.</p>

<p>The most artistic use of plaster was for the modelled
heads, which were placed on mummy cases
in Roman times. Though most such works were
rather crude, some are found which show real ability
of portraiture. In <a href="#fig135">fig. 135</a> we have a sympathetic
study of the face of a young man. The lips are
beautifully true, the modelling of the cheek is quite
natural, the nose and brow well formed; only the
eyes have been left blank, and marked afterwards
with colour. The head, <a href="#fig135">fig. 136</a>, is evidently a careful
study, giving the cautious, cold expression of
the man. Another face (<a href="#fig135">fig. 137</a>) is subtle, and full
of feeling: the faint smile on the lips, the gracious
contour of the cheek, the wavy hair, give a memory
in death of a real personality. The only jarring
feature is the square brow, copied from an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
convention in Greek art. The eyes are here
again left blank; but they seem to have been intended
to be open, by the slight ridge of the raised
lid. Was there a convention of regarding the dead
as incapable of seeing, though seen by memory?
How far these modelled heads were portraits is
answered in a curious way by <a href="#fig135">fig. 138</a>. The light
outline there is that of the plaster modelling, the
dark outline within it is the skull from the interior
of the coffin. It will be seen how exactly they
agree; there is a thin skin over the forehead, then
a fleshy part to the brow. Along the bridge of the
nose the model closely follows the bone; below the
nose the angle of meeting of the jaws exactly agrees,
leaving a uniform thickness of lips; and lastly, the
fleshy fulness of the chin is seen projecting. This
agreement is one which the artist could never have
expected to be thus tested, and therefore gives us
the more confidence in his skill.</p>

<p>Though leather hides, with the hair on, are found
over bodies in the earliest graves, yet linen cloth
was introduced early in the prehistoric times, and
is frequently found wrapped around the bodies.</p>

<p>On reaching the first dynasty the weaving is seen
to be very fine and regular, though we only have
some of the stuff used for mummy wrappings, from
the tomb of King Zer. The threads are very uniform,
and there are 160 to the inch in the warp and
120 in the woof. Modern fine cambric has 140
threads to the inch, so it was quite equalled by hand
work at the beginning of Egyptian history. A
group of a dozen different cloths on one mummy of
the XVIIth dynasty show 138 x 40 and 128 x 56
as the finest, and 21 x 15 as the coarsest mesh. The
greatest disproportion of the threads is 138 to 40,
or 3½ to 1, and the least is 70 to 62, or 9 to 8; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
recognised as a principle of Egyptian weaving that
the woof was not beaten up as closely as the lay of
the warp. Unfortunately we have scarcely any cloth
except mummy wrappings, and it is not to be expected
that the finest work would be thus used.</p>

<p>The size of the looms was considerable. The
cloths on the mummy just named are up to five feet
wide; and one edge has been torn off that amount,
so it was originally more. The pieces are up to sixty
feet long, and yet not complete. The looms were
horizontal on the ground for coarse work, such as
mats; but fine work was done on a vertical loom,
and from the ease of displacing threads in tapestry
the warp threads were separately weighted and not
fastened to a beam. Loom weights of baked clay
or of limestone are common.</p>

<p class="caption">139. Coloured tapestry (XVIIIth dynasty)</p>

<p class="caption">140. Cut leather net</p>

</div>

<p>A few pieces of woven tapestry have been found
in the tomb of Tahutmes IV, and part of one is
given here full size in <a href="#fig139">fig. 139</a>. The colours used
are red, blue, green, yellow, brown and grey. The
coloured threads pass to and fro over the space
assigned to them, thus entirely parting the warp
threads from the neighbouring ones, so that a slit
is left along the vertical margins of the colours. This
was remedied by stitching; but the same weakness
is seen in the Roman and Coptic woven tapestries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
These are known from the pagan period, as there
are many mythological subjects; but the greater
part belong to the Christian and Mohammedan ages.</p>

<p>The Roman and Coptic tapestries are placed
upon garments as derivatives from darning, or from
patches put on the garments to prevent them wearing
through. The positions are broad stripes over the
shoulders where any object would rest when carried,
circular patches on the breasts and on the knees.
On referring to the hundreds of figures in Roman
dress from the third to fifth centuries (in Garucci,
<i>Vetri ornati di figure in oro</i>), embroideries or tapestries
are unusual in Italy. A dozen robes with scrolls
or foliage patterns are shown, but only three with
knee patches, and one of those (xxxi, 1) is a female
servant holding an Egyptian fan, probably therefore
an Egyptian slave. It seems, then, that this
system of circular patches on the wearing parts is
not Roman but Egyptian. Beside the woven tapestries,
which are nearly all in purple, embroidery was
done with the needle in white thread on the purple
ground.</p>

<p>Leatherwork was of importance in Egypt in all
ages. The two principal arts in it were the appliqué
work in colours, and the cutting of network. The
great example of the appliqué work is the funeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tent of Queen Isiemkheb, about 1000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> It was
eight feet long and seven feet wide, with sides over
five feet high. Six vultures are outspread along the
top, and the sides have a long inscription. The
whole of the figures and signs are cut out in
variously coloured leather, and stitched on to the
crimson leather ground. This work we can trace
in the style of earlier decorations, back to the head
fillet of Nofert, <a href="#fig23">fig. 24</a>. It is also continued down
to the present day in the appliqué work in coloured
stuffs on the inside of Egyptian tents.</p>

<p>The cutting of leather nets was an art of great
skill. Rows of slits were cut, breaking joint one
with other, so that a piece of leather could be drawn
out sideways into a wide net. One of the most
delicate of such nets is partly shown in <a href="#fig139">fig. 140</a>.
The square patch left in the middle of the net was
for the wear of sitting on when the net was put
over the linen waist cloth. Such nets over the cloth
are shown in the figures of the harvesters, <a href="#fig69">fig. 70</a>,
with the slit network and the square patch. To cut
the leather in such extremely fine threads must
have required great skill and care; and not only is
the leather slit, but considerable slips have been
removed so as to produce an open net close up to
the edge band of solid leather; on some edges an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
inch or two is cut away to form one side of the
rhombic opening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In many directions we have now traced the outlines
of the artistic skill of the Egyptians, but only
outlines, which point incessantly to the wide spaces
that need to be filled in by further detail. Much of
that has yet to be discovered, but much is ready to
hand whensoever a careful observer may choose to
devote attention to any of the branches of art or
technical work which we have so briefly noticed.
In every direction a complete collecting of materials
and an adequate publication of them would bring
a full reward in results.</p>

<p>The powerful technical skill of Egyptian art, its
good sense of limitations, and its true feeling for
harmony and expression, will always make it of the
first importance to the countries of the West with
which it was so early and so long connected.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">EGYPT’S PLACE IN THE ART OF THE WORLD</span></h2>

<p>In the opening chapter we have considered the point
of view from which the art of Egypt&mdash;like that of
every other country&mdash;must be approached. The
physical conditions which surround man will necessarily
control his expression of thought and his perception
of beauty. Forms and designs growing out
of the conditions of one land will be inappropriate
in another land, and lose most, or all, of their value
if transported to different surroundings. Hence it
is futile to attempt to contrast the art of one country
directly with that of another. We might as well compare
the beauty of a tropical garden with that of an alpine
forest. The only ground of comparison is that of
expressing the character and emotions of the artists;
and that art which conveys the mental state of the
people most readily is the most perfect art. This
criticism leaves aside altogether the moral question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of our appreciation of the people themselves; that
does not belong to art but to ethics. And before we
can begin to judge of that, we must know their surroundings,
and the position in which they were conditioned
in the world.</p>

<p>Our consideration here is with the art. When we
look over the varied artistic expression of different
races, we see that each people has seized some one
excellence, growing out of its conditions, and adapted
to its feelings and utilities. We can admire each
excellence in turn, and see that in each of these
qualities no other people has reached the same perfection.
We must recognise that artistic expression
is not only shown in sculpture and painting, but in
literature, mechanical design, and the amenities and
adaptation of the social organism.</p>

<p>In Egypt, as we have noticed, the ruling principles
of the art are durability, strength, and dignity, and
such were the features of the national character. In
vain do we look in any other country for as great an
expression of any of these principles. And, with the
single exception of Greece, it was also supreme in
precision of work. Its work was the true expression
of character, and in perfect harmony with the
nature of the country.</p>

<p>In Crete, so far as we can yet see, the pre-eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
facilities were the expression of motion, and the development
of decorative form, and especially colour,
upon pottery. Classical art never attained to the
skill shown by the prehistoric art in these directions.</p>

<p>In Assyria, figure and animal sculpture stood very
high in the best period; and the free adaptation of
this to the purposes of life, as we see in the great
development of friezes on the palace walls, was the
distinguishing feature. No people seem to have
lived amidst their art more than the Assyrians.</p>

<p>In classical Greece, the supremacy in vital sculpture
and architectural proportion has so filled the
attention of the modern world that the higher
achievement of surrounding nations in other directions
has been largely overlooked. In each of the
special qualities that we note in other peoples the
Greeks were their inferiors.</p>

<p>Rome was largely dominated by other races in
its development; but in the art of civilisation and
raising subject peoples, in the shaping of life and
rule of law, it stood far above any ancient nation.
In this&mdash;as in the arts elsewhere&mdash;we must look
at its best period, when the impartiality and probity
of its administrators brought all Greece under their
sway.</p>

<p>The Celtic and Northern arts stood first in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
rhythm of intricate decoration, and the subtlety of
the curves; the ideal may not appeal to us, but no
other region has ever produced such perfect and
complex design.</p>

<p>In Medieval Europe, though sculpture scarcely
reached the vitality of classical work, yet in expression
it stood as high as in any school of art; and in
the architecture the sense of expansion and aspiration&mdash;the
spiritual aspect&mdash;reaches a higher level
than man has touched elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Italy, the expression of art in painting was its
great achievement, in harmony with the character
of grace seen in other lines of Italian production.</p>

<p>The Persian and Mesopotamian civilisation triumphed
in its glorious use of coloured glaze decoration,
which has been carried westward to Syria and
Rhodes, and still continues in the vast domes of
coloured tiles in Spain.</p>

<p>In Arab art we meet the exquisite calm of geometrical
design with various angles, which cannot
be analysed at a glance like a Roman pavement:
they arrest the eye to linger over them, to seek how
they arise, and what they mean.</p>

<p>Further east, it is difficult for us to enter sufficiently
into the fundamental feelings of the races, to
enable us to value their art truly. But we can at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
least feel the grand sense of profusion when looking
at the mountainous structures of the immense topes
and pagodas of India, peopled with innumerable
figures on countless stages. To the minds which
produce and live amongst such forms, all other work
must seem poor and bare. In Chinese art we can
admire the fine adaptation and the sense of minute
perfection in the articles before us, the dignity and
reserve shown; and, in the literature, even a stranger
to the land can feel the intimate harmony with Nature,
and the mystic sense of mood in the mountains and
trees and lakes around. Hardly any other poetry
that we know touches the spirit of life so essentially.</p>

<p>The facile Japanese may well claim an unsurpassed
skill and deftness in the painting of Nature,
and a power to grasp the greatest amount of reality
with the least means. Their perception of Nature
in its strange and mysterious moods, which they
show by the brush, is almost as penetrating as in
the literature of China. Their exquisite sense of
fitness, and of taste for beauty of workmanship, only
makes us begin to realise the clumsiness of our own
cast-iron performances.</p>

<p>To wander so far from Egypt may seem needless;
and it would be so if the essentials of other arts were
more familiar in English works. We have read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lately of an alleged “tyranny of the Nile”; but the
real tyranny over English minds for a century past
has been the “tyranny of the Hellene.” The
one side of art in sculpture has obscured all others;
and the English mind has, with its usual idolatry,
made the standard of Greece its sole measure. We
need to see that a dozen national arts have each
been supreme over the others in some one aspect.
Then we shall see how meaningless it is to contrast
the excellence of one national art with another.
Each country has to confess that it has only fully
expressed one aspect out of many in the immense
range of human life.</p>

<p>Now we can begin to see the real meaning of the
so-called limitations of Egyptian art. Every people
has had its limitations likewise, fitting it to its conditions;
and if we look at them all impartially, and
not by the standard of any one of them, we shall see
that the deficiencies and limitations of most races
are of much the same extent. If the Egyptian had
tried to render not only character, but emotion also,
he would have been defying his true conditions, as
much as if we put a dado of Persian glazed tiles on
the Parthenon. To refer this artistic perception to
the uniformity of the Nile, is about as true as if we
attributed any deficiencies in German art or literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to the prevalence of cold and snow, which is a
far greater tyranny than the inundation. Every
physical circumstance is a factor in human work,
but none of them singly dominates it. There is no
point in calling the Egyptian childish in his abilities,
as every other nation has been equally childish
in some other respects&mdash;the Roman in his abject
submission to omens, the Greek in playing with
words, the Assyrian in his inaccuracy, the Arab in
his drawing. In short, there is no essential difference
in the capacity for showing national life and
feeling by the art of each country; and in the facility
and truth of expression Egypt stands in the first
rank of those lands where Art has exhibited the
character of man.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
